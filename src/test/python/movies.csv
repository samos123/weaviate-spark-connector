In part, the reasons for and the claims made of his work support Virgilio Tosi's thesis that cinema was invented out of the needs of scientific research. Conversely, they're informed by Muybridge's background as an artistic location photographer and, as Phillip Prodger suggests, in book sales and more useful to art than to science, as Marta Braun has demonstrated (see sources at bottom). Additionally, Muybridge quickly exploited their entertainment value via projection to audiences across the U.S. and Europe. Muybridge pursued both of these paths of invention: the path taken by Jules Janssen, Étienne-Jules Marey and others for science and the path taken by Ottomar Anschütz, Thomas Edison, the Lumiére brothers and others for fame and profit.

Muybridge began taking instantaneous single photographs of multi-millionaire railroad magnate Leland Stanford's horses in motion in 1872. It was disputed at the time whether all four of a horse's legs were off the ground simultaneously at any time while running. Although no surviving photographs prove it, contemporary lithographs and paintings likely based on the photographs, indeed, show the moment of ""unsupported transit"". In between and interrupting these experiments, Muybridge was found not guilty of the admittedly premeditated fatal shooting of his wife's lover and possibly her son's father.

Publication of Marey's graphic measurements of a horse's movements reignited Stanford's interest in the gait of horses. In turn, Marey was convinced to switch to photography in his motion studies after witnessing Muybridge's work (see ""Falling Cat"" (1894)). This work in ""automatic electro-photographs"" began in 1878 at Stanford's Palo Alto Stock Farm. Multiple cameras were stored in a shed parallel to a track. A series of closing boards serving as shutters were triggered by tripped threads and electrical means. The wet collodion process of the time, reportedly, could need up to half a minute for an exposure. For the split-second shutter speeds required here, a white canvas background and powdered lime on the track provided more contrast to compensate for less light getting to the glass plates. Employees of Stanford's Central Pacific Railroad and others helped in constructing this ""set"" and camera equipment.

Contrary to unattributed claims on the web, this so-called ""Sallie Gardner at a Gallop"" wasn't the first series photographed by Muybridge. Six series of Muybridge's first subjects were published on cards entitled ""The Horse in Motion"". The first is of the horse Abe Edgington trotting on 11 June 1878. Reporters were invited for the next two series on June 15th, and, as they reported, again, Abe went first—trotting and pulling the driver behind in a sulky, which is what tripped the threads. The second subject that day was Sallie Gardner running and, thus, the mare had to trip the threads. Reporters noted how this spooked her and how that was reflected in the negatives developed on the spot. As one article said, she ""gave a wild bound in the air, breaking the saddle girth as she left the ground."" Based on such descriptions, it doesn't seem that this series exists anymore. The animations on the web that are actually of Sallie are dated June 19th on ""The Horse in Motion"" card. Many animations claimed to be Sallie on YouTube, Wikipedia and elsewhere, as of this date, are actually of a mare named Annie G. and were part of Muybridge's University of Pennsylvania work published in 1887, as the Library of Congress and other reliable sources have made clear. The early Palo Alto photographs aren't as detailed and are closer to silhouettes. The 12 images of Gardner also include one where she's stationary. The Morse's Gallery pictures are entirely in silhouette, while the La Nature engravings of these same images show the rider in a white shirt.

The shot of the horse stationary, as Braun points out, was added later and is indicative of the artistic and un-scientific assemblages Muybridge made of his images—with the intent of publication, including in his own books. This was especially prominent in his Pennsylvania work, which included many nude models that were surely useful for art. Muybridge influenced artists from Realists like Thomas Eakins and Meissonier, Impressionists like Edgar Degas and Frederick Remington, to the more abstract works of Francis Bacon. His precedence has also been cited in the photography of Steven Pippin and Hollis Frampton, as well as the bullet-time effects in ""The Matrix"" (1999).

Muybridge lectured on this relationship with art when touring with his Zoöpraxiscope, which was a combination of the magic lantern and phenakistoscope. With it, he projected, from glass disks, facsimiles of his photographs hand-painted by Erwin Faber. Without intermittent movement, the Zoöpraxiscope compressed the images, so elongated drawings were used instead of photographs. Muybridge and others also used his images for phenakistoscopes and zoetropes. The first demonstration of the Zoöpraxiscope was to Stanford and friends in the autumn of 1879. A public demonstration was given on 4 May 1880 for the San Francisco art association, and Muybridge continued these lectures for years—personally touring the U.S. and Europe. Although there were predecessors in animated projections as far back as 1847 by Leopold Ludwig Döbler, in 1853 by Franz von Uchatius, and with posed photographs by Henry Heyl in 1870, the chronophotographic and artistic basis offered some novelty for Muybridge's presentations. They also led him to meet Edison and Marey and inspire the likes of Anschütz and others—those who took the next steps in the invention of movies.

In terms of 19th century technology, which is the context in which it should be reviewed, this film is cutting edge.

The subject is recognisably a road across a city centre bridge in Victorian times. We have all seen plenty of still photographs from that era but in this composition, the horses and people actually move. I come from Yorkshire and I know that one branch of my family was resident in Leeds at this time so, who knows, one of those people could be a long-lost ancestor of mine. That's a romantic view but you really can't take anything other than a romantic view of something like this.

Unlike the better-known chronophotographers Eadweard Muybridge and Étienne-Jules Marey, whose concerns were artistic and scientific, respectively, Anschütz mainly photographed serial images with the intent to reproduce their motion for public entertainment and to do so on an industrial scale, which today's authority on Anschütz, Deac Rossell, has made clear in various writings. In this regard, Anschütz's career shared more with those of Thomas Edison and the Lumiére brothers. As Friedrich Tietjen has pointed out, however, the loop mode for the synthesis of Anschütz's images, as well as Muybridge's, demanded and created different experiences than celluloid films.

Anschütz was a professional photographer and a leader in the development of instantaneous photography before he took up chronophotography. His 1884 photographs of storks in flight inspired aviation pioneer Otto Lilienthal, whose gliding flights were also photographed by Anschütz (and others). For his earliest sequential photography, Anschütz copied Muybridge's system from Palo Alto, where a battery of cameras in a shed recorded horses in motion. He improved upon Muybridge's system, however, by inventing a focal-plane shutter. In 1886, he and an organ-builder named Schneider invented an apparatus of multiple small cameras for his work at Hanover, which was commissioned by the Prussian government for improving cavalry riding techniques and other military investigations.

Anschütz and Schneider also made their first version of a viewing device for reproducing motion in 1886. Anschütz built various machines for synthesis during his career and called them the ""Schnellseher"" (""quick viewer"")—also known as the ""Tachyscope"" or ""Electrical Wonder"". All models featured the images on either a disc or a strip, in the tradition of the optical toys the Phenakistiscope and the Zoetrope. The most commonly reproduced picture of a Schnellseher, a Scientific America illustration, is of an early version where a large Phenakitiscope wheel was turned on one side of a wall while several people viewed the continuous motion of up to 24 images per scene on the other end. The first public demonstration of it was given on 19 March 1887 for his patrons at the Prussian Culture Ministry in Berlin and other guests. Other versions of the Schnellseher were for home use, including Zoetrope improvements and ""Sprechende Porträts"" (""Speaking Portraits""), the latter of which likely inspired Georges Demeny's Phonoscope (see ""Je vous aime"" (1891)).

Likewise, the coin-operated peephole automated Schnellsehers were a precursor to the Kinetoscope. (According to Gordon Hendricks in his book ""The Edison Motion Picture Myth"", Edison's team, at one point in their invention trials, likely built their own Schnellseher.) The company Siemens and Halske manufactured these devices, and they were exhibited throughout Europe and the United States. They premiered 16 May 1891 in Frankfurt. At the 1893 World's Columbian Fair in Chicago, they competed with Muybridge's Zoöpraxiscope. Unlike the Zoöpraxiscope, the Schnellsehers incorporated intermittent movement from a flashing Geissler tube, which allowed for the use of photographs instead of the drawn animation used by Muybridge. Most impressively, Anschütz demonstrated a Projecting Electrotachyscope on 25 November 1894 in Berlin and began exhibitions for a paying public on 22 February 1895. This system included an intermittent Maltese-cross movement and projected images on a large screen measuring about 6 by 8 meters (19 ½ by 26 ¼ feet). Predating this, Henry Heyl had projected photographic images of a waltzing couple and other scenes in 1870 with his Phasmatrope, but those were of individually posed pictures rather than subjects captured instantaneously in real motion.

Horses, as with Muybridge and Marey, were a popular subject for Anschütz. All three men's enthusiasm for horses was also borne of scientific inquiry: training for sport in the case of Muybridge, physiological analysis for Marey, and military training for Anschütz. Two of his surviving series are from his Hanover work of military riders on horses jumping over obstacles. Three other remaining series available on the web and elsewhere are of athletic feats. Contemporaries remarked on the superior quality of his dry-plate images compared to the work of Muybirdge and Marey. It's somewhat odd, then, that historians have written much about the influence Muybridge and Marey had on art and have found no such connection with Anschütz. (See ""Sallie Gardner at a Gallop"" (1880) and ""Falling Cat"" (1894).) Lost scenes made by Anschütz, however, suggest a more direct influence on subsequent entertainment filmmaking. A scene of card players may have been the basis for remakes by the Lumière brothers (""Partie d'écarté"") and Georges Méliès (""Une partie de cartes"") (both 1896). His barbershop scene perhaps inspired the Kinetoscope film ""The Barbershop"" (1894) or been a remake of it. Others seem to have been similar to comic expression films that were a popular subject in early cinema.

Yet, unlike the celluloid films, the movies of Anschütz's spinning discs and drums, as Tietjen has written, were circular—rather than the linear nature of film that allowed, eventually, for narratives. They lasted only a second or two, but would repeat on a loop so long as the disc or drum were turned and unchanged. Naturally repetitive motions such as galloping horses fit this loop mode well, whereas these lost scenes may have appeared unrealistic. Tietjen, however, mentions how a film such as the Lumières' ""La sortie des usines Lumière"" (1895), with its opening and closing of the gates, could also conform to a loop.

Anschütz's attempts to industrially commercialize his motion photographs as entertainment represent the pinnacle of the loop mode of movies—ending just as celluloid films were taking off. Despite the differences of these formats, the work of Anschütz was of significant influence on early filmmaking.

It is, however, one of the oldest surviving films and is believed to be the earliest film made in the United States. Indeed, Edison deserves tremendous amount of acclaim for his contributions to the art of film. Although Eadweard Muybridge and others may have pioneered what eventually became the motion picture camera, it was Edison's visionary desire to develop a device that could ""do for the eye what the phonograph does for the ear,"" and put it to commercial use, that led to the birth of films as we know them today. The Gay Nineties saw the emergence of this new art form and started to grasp at its limitless possibilities. Many of these early films are essentially short subject documentary films, dubbed ""Actualities,"" that show snapshots of life during the final decade of the 19th century.

In 1890, film was going through its birth pangs. Edison and his team struggled to perfect a device that would create the illusion of life and movement from a series of still images. At this phase, the motion picture camera had not been invented yet. Edison's idea for projecting these images was to have a photographic filmstrip spiraling around a cylinder device (not unlike a phonograph), and the viewer would watch through a peephole kinetoscope. Monkeyshines No. 1 and No. 2 are early examples of films made using this process. At the time they were made, they were never intended for public exhibition; they were merely an internal test run of the system. Filmmakers William K.L. Dickson and William Heise shot these tests using lab worker G. Sacco Albanese as their subject. They were filmed outside Building 4 of the Edison Laboratory facility, which was used for performing iron-ore milling experiments.

These two films are impossible to review from a critical standpoint. They are not meant to be entertainment or art. They are, essentially, experiments in a new technological process. Both consist of Mr. Albanese doing little more than flail his arms, stretch, and move around for the benefit of the camera. The rudimentary technology that captured these images has not weathered the ravages of time very well, and Monkeyshines No. 1, in particular, has a very phantasmagorical effect as Albanese appears almost ghostly. Perhaps that is fitting, as these film remnants have allowed a ghostly image of him to live on over a century after the man himself passed away. Monkeyshines No. 2 is a little clearer in its presentation, but essentially more of the same. A casual viewer looking for even the tiniest shred of entertainment will walk away disappointed. However, the more intrepid film buff will likely find some interest, even if only academic, as part of a broader examination of both the origins of film and the Edison Company in particular. Either way, the story behind this early film is more interesting than the product itself, and one should approach it solely as a historical artifact.",1M

As with the first ""Monkeyshines"" movie, this one consists of some brief footage of playful activity in the Edison Company facility. Compared with the first one, the figures are a little less ghostly and a little better defined, and the motions are slightly easier to determine. It still has the weird, surreal appearance of aliens or ghosts or abstract shapes, just not to quite the same degree.

Both ""Monkeyshines"" features were made when Edison was pursuing the idea of a cylindrical approach to motion pictures, by close analogy with his successful phonograph idea.

The footage shows two men in a boxing ring, but they actually do little serious boxing. The purpose was not entertainment, but rather to test the camera, by taking footage of different movements and then also playing it at different speeds in the completed film. The simulated boxing ring in the Edison studio, the contrast between dark and light areas in the camera field, and the different behavior of the boxers, are all part of the camera test.

Nevertheless, the early Edison film crews seemed to have had a sense of humor, and the contrast between the serious-looking boxer on the left and the very non-serious cutup on the right makes it more interesting to look at than a mere technical shot would have been.",1M

It was known that a french inventor named Louis Le Prince had made a movie in Leeds, England, in 1888; and Edison wanted to know how to make his own. Soon the idea came to him and he began working on his devise, however, he lost interest in it as he couldn't see any potential in the invention. Fortunately, one of his collaborators, Scottish inventor William K.L. Dickson decided to take the project and in 1890 he developed what would later be known as the Kinetoscope, a devise that showed short movies through the window of a cabinet. However, the movies Dickson made wasn't of a good quality, so he spent the following years trying to make something as good (or better) than what Le Prince had achieved. Many experiments were done, and by 1891, Dickson and his team were almost there.

After the moderate success of his ""Monkeyshines"" experiments, Dickson knew he was able to capture images and reproduce them in his Kinetoscope, now all he had to do was to improve the quality of his movies. 1891 would be a year of constant experimenting, in hopes of showing the invention at the Chicago's World Fair. And among the films that Dickson was able to make during those years was this experimental movie codenamed ""Newark Athlete"". This movie depicted a man, apparently an athlete (although he could had been one of Edison's workers) as does some exercises swinging the clubs he has in each of his hands. The man raises the heads of clubs and keeps moving them for as long as the movie lasts, obviously hoping that his movements were being captured by the camera.

Like most of Dickson's experiments, there was no plot or theme in the film, as this movies weren't meant to be shown to the public. The main purpose of the film is to check if the camera was able to capture the movements of the athlete, and to measure elements such as lighting, the quality of the lenses, the film and the recording speed. When compared to the ""Monkeyshines"" films, this movie shows a notorious improvement in the quality of the film, as the image not only moves at a fluid speed, it's almost as clear as Dickson intended. It wouldn't take him too long before he was able to make short films the way he wanted, and soon in that year he would make the first Kinetoscope movie shown to an audience: ""Dickson Greeting"", where he was welcoming us to the era of Kinetoscope. 6/10",1M

This required close views of the performer's lip movements. The project was given to Demeny by Étienne-Jules Marey, who headed the Station Physiologique in Paris and whose chronophotographic scientific research of motion is among the most important contributions to the invention of movies. Despite these educational and scientific beginnings, however, this project led Demeny to pursue and influence the commercialism of cinema.

Demeny as Marey's assistant at the Physiological Station was Virgilio Tosi says, ""more than a mere second lead"", especially given that Marey annually spent winters vacationing and working in Naples while leaving Demeny in charge of the Station. Demeny's interests were especially in physical education and, over the years, he and Marey photographed many gymnastics acts. Demeny assisted Marey from 1881 to 1894. In those years, they went from using a photographic gun to record images on rotating glass plates to using celluloid film rolls in the ""Chronophotographe"" camera. It was this project, initially for the education of the deaf, which led to their acrimonious divorce, as Marey continued to use film for his scientific research and Demeny pursued its commercial applications.

The films by themselves would be of little use for education. Although Marey was continually tinkering with his cameras and adopting new photographic processes, he seemed to be less interested in reproducing the illusion of motion. Although he made a projector as early as 1892, he was largely content with using a Zoetrope for confirmation and wasn't satisfied with a projector of his own until 1896. Demeny constructed a single-viewer device named the Photophone and, then, a projecting version called the Phonoscope. Like other early ""movie"" machines, these used images on a revolving Phenakistoscope disc and, in the case of the projector, added the principles of the magic lantern. Leopold Ludwig Döbler did as much with drawn animation in the 1840s, Franz von Uchatius in the 1850s, Henry Heyl with posed photographs in 1870 and Eadweard Muybridge with drawings based on chronophotography in the 1880s and early 1890s. Deac Rossell suggests that Ottomar Anschütz's work, especially, inspired Demeny. Demeny's Phonoscope was novel, however, in that, as Laurent Mannoni says, ""For the first time chronophotographic pictures on a disc could be projected in sequence."" To accomplish this, film positives were cut and pasted onto glass disks, which was an obvious obstacle to mass productions and was limited to the length of each rotation—before the scene repeated itself—to only a second or two.

The Phonoscope was first presented to the Académie des Sciences on 27 July 1891. A Parisian audience of 1200 saw the Phonoscope and 30 films on 6 December, and the device was exhibited again in Paris at the Exposition Internationale de Photographie from 20 April 1892. Images of the Phonoscope and of ""Je vous aime"" were also printed in the publications ""L'Illustration"", ""Paris-Photographe"" and ""La Nature"". Hailed as the ""optical equivalent of the phonograph"" (Braun), Demeny dreamed of his machine replacing still photographs in frames and albums at home and combining it with the Phonograph to complete the illusion. Other aspirations included peephole slot-machines and larger projections for public consumption. With investors, Demeny founded the Phonoscope, Living Portrait, and Animated Picture Company on 20 December 1892 to market it.

As Rossell's research shows, Anschütz had been marketing ""Sprechende Porträts"" months before Demeny's ""portraits parlants"" (both translate as ""Speaking Portraits""). Anschütz's movies also appeared in coin-operated peephole automats in public parlours as early as 1891—anticipating the later Kinetoscope parlours and the failed plans of Demeny's group. Demeny's subsequent inventions for the intermittent movement of film and his contacts with two companies—the Lumières and Gaumont—seem of more original and lasting consequence to the history of early cinema.

His addition of a beater mechanism for intermittent movement to Marey's Chronophotographe, along with the Phonoscope, was marketed by Léon Gaumont in November 1895, but these devices were soon superseded by the Lumière brothers' reversible camera/projector Cinématographe. Before licensing and, eventually, selling his patents to Gaumont, Demeny looked to the Lumières for financing. In December 1894, Demeny showed his sketches for a ""Grande Projecteur"" to Louis Lumière. As Rossell reports, this large projector had ""a new intermittent movement using a pair of claws motivated by an eccentric cam: the kernel of the later Cinématographe Lumière."" With Léopold René Decaux, Demeny built his own reversible camera/projector, for Gaumont, in 1896. Gaumont eventually became one of the biggest movie studios in the world. Demeny's camera was used until 1914, including by Alice Guy, and the beater mechanism was widely used during the era, including in Edison's Vitascope.

The medium close-up also became popular in early cinema. The Edison Company used it to impressive effect on the screen in ""The Kiss"" (1896). Although Marey and Muybridge had photographed serial close-up images of hands and, in Marey's case, the human face, there was nothing proceeding ""Je vous aime"" for the close-up movie image being publicly projected. Despite Demeny's grimaced closed eyes—a consequence of trying to block out the sunrays reflected from the mirrors used to achieve the desired strongly lit facial features—and the film's brevity, it's not difficult to see how audiences would've been impressed and why it inspired such financial hopes. Regardless, Demeny was one of the most important pioneers in the invention of cinema—bridging the gap from chronophotography to cinema.

Two of Robert Paul's earliest films were ""Rough Seas at Margate"" -- indeed, he shot two variations of it. It's hard to imagine that Paul had not seen or at least heard of Marey's efforts, which he spent the 1880s producing, after he had invented the ""chronophotograph gun"". Birt Acres also did a version of this, with ""Rough Seas at Dover"". Thus, you could say that Marey invented the first film genre, even before the Butterfly Dance movies, or people coming out of factories on their ways home.

Marey also did an ur-cartoon, ""L'Homme Machine"" but never seems to have capitalized on his inventions in this particular field. He remains an interesting bypath in the invention of cinema.",1M

K. L. Dickson. I have seen only about five of his films, and it's apparent that only two seconds of screen time were as far as he got, but they are every bit as important as any other films during this period as originating the motion picture industry. This film, an example of his early work, is one that has surprisingly good picture quality for a movie of 1891. It runs for a short two seconds and features two unidentified fencers going at eachother.

While there is indeed a rumor spread from countless sources on the internet that Georges Méliès's ""Card Party"" was the very first remake ever in film history, (a remake of the Lumiere's ""Partie d'Ecarte"") this film is all the evidence you need that that theory is incorrect. Edison's ""Fencing"", a test film of 1892, can and should receive the attribution to this title of being the first remake. As stated previously, it was made a year later than this, and is slightly different in terms of action (as it's really only a sword clash compared to the actual talent displayed in here), yet this concept of fencing being reproduced on film is still there. It remains to be discovered if Edison was influenced by this 1891 film or not. Even if both films were independent of one another, ""Two Fencers"" remains an important film as being the preface (or inspiration) for the first remake in film history.

On a side note, ""Monkeyshines, No.2"" cannot really be considered as being a remake; both the first and second films were probably never even titled originally, and if the picture quality was any clearer, we could tell that the action and the person are completely different in both. In the day, they were probably seen as independent tests, not at all as one being a remake of the other.",1M

Sadly, Reynaud was not only something of a perfectionist who personally hand-painted every image of every film, he also only trusted himself to operate the screenings. and therefore stretched himself a little too far. He was hugely successful before the advent of movies, but was incapable of progressing and stands as a singular warning of the fate that befalls any business that fails to adapt to a changing market. The film has historical importance, and as a bitter and impoverished Reynaud destroyed most of his films years after the film industry had made his shows obsolete, it's something of a minor miracle that it still exists today.",4M

Take, for example, the beautifully photographed ""Dickson Greeting"" and ""Men Boxing"" of the previous year and compare it to this short: why did the quality drop so low? ""A Handshake"" is grainy, blurry and poorly lit, (how'd were they even able to identify Dickson and Heise as the two men?) and I have a hard time understanding why this was so. Either time has not been easy on the film, they used a different type of filmstrip which proved unsuccessful, or they altered the camera to improve the visual look even more and actually made it worse. Either way, it's mystifying to see how poor the footage is when viewed now.

I can't blame it all on time, filmstrip or camera, though, as there is yet another possible reason why the end result is so bad. Let's suppose that I was trying to invent the Kinetograph, and I would want a good test subject: would I want to go with a small gesture of little movement or a big gesture with a clear amount of action? Clearly the latter, and I think that's what caused this experiment to end up not as successful: the little gesture within frame doesn't show a obvious movement and thus makes the motion not as clear when seen now. An exaggerated wave or a bow would have provided a much better amount of movement.

But it's good to experiment, and I'm sure the results of this test (for that's all it is, a test) taught Heise and Dickson a very important lesson.",1M

The image quality isn't the greatest but the movements look at all times smooth and that's of course what was most important for Edison and Co. at the time.

He was quite a celebrity back in his time and had friends in the highs societies of which Thomas Edison also appeared to be one of. He also seemed to be a generous person, who also contributed a lot to the world of bodybuilding. Some of his influences and ideas are even still notable today.

He takes lots of different positions within this short film, exhibiting his muscular physique. Sometimes he goes a bit out of frame with his arms, which of course obviously was not intended and sort of makes you question if Edison and Co. were also happy with the result.

Even though he was only 27 at the time, he looked much older. He also died at a fairly young age of 58 years. But who knows, perhaps he looks old in this because the image quality of course also isn't the highest.

So perhaps with some imagination you can call this movie the first ever made spoof and it certainly is the first ever done comical subject at the Thomas Edison's Black Maria Studios.

The subject of Professor Welton (exactly what was he a professor in I wonder?) Vaudeville's act of two boxing cats is sort of amusing and cute. No doubt that animal right organizations now days would do anything to ban this movie from being shown was it made today but truth is that this is a pretty harmless act. The gloves take away a lot of the blow, so no cats got harmed during the making of this motion picture and actually seeing cats fight on the streets with their claws is of course something far more violent and violent looking, even though it's just nature, unlike obviously putting gloves on a couple of cats and let them fight in a small boxing ring.

Henry Welton himself (the professor from this movie its title) sets the cats up against each other and he can be seen picking them up toward each other. These two cats obviously had no grudge toward each other but were put up to it to fight. Perhaps not the most kind thing to do but you also have to remember that this was 1894 when these sort of animal vaudeville acts were very common and part of everyday's life.

The camera is pretty close up to the fight but it covers the entire fighting area. It's not entirely symmetric, since it only shows one side of the ring. Nevertheless it's an effective composition, since it shows everything that needs to be seen and apart from its shaking images, it's perfect. The same can be said about the quality of the movie. Hardly any grain here in this one.

A nice little comical turn from the boys at the Edison Manufacturing Company.

This film was more energetic than most shorts from 1894. Oakley's shooting seems to be live and real, especially when shooting at the board. It is hard to tell if she is hitting the tossed targets, but we can still tell the great skill she has. She was probably the biggest star the filmed by the Edison duo in 1894.

If it were nothing more than one simple scene of a band at practice, then there are only a couple of details that would be worth noticing, so that it would be of limited interest at best. But it is more interesting when seen with its original setting in mind.

This was one of several features (most of them now lost), filmed by the Edison Company, in which they re-enacted scenes from Charles Hoyt's stage show 'A Milk White Flag'. The now-forgotten Hoyt specialized in plays that that satirized or parodied contemporary attitudes and trends, and/or human nature in general. This scene comes from a musical that in large part poked fun at the military and patriotic spirit that was so widespread in the USA in the 1890s (and which culminated, later in the decade, in the popular demand for war with Spain).

In this short scene, the self-important band-leader leads his players into position, in a parody of the pomp and pride that was associated with the state and local militias of the era. Hoyt's production was designed to deflate them just a bit in the popular mind, not by showing any disrespect for genuine patriotism, but by depicting how some persons saw the military lifestyle simply as a way of promoting themselves socially or politically.

With its historical and social background, the brief movie takes on more significance, in calling attention to social trends that were soon to have their effect on world events.",1M

Their promotions of boxing, belly-dancing and outright violence are responsible for all of the garbage that is filmed constantly in Hollywood today. ""Cock Fight, No. 2"" is a perfect example of how eager they were to make money filming violent topics. To film two cocks attacking each-other with such viciousness would be illegal and frowned upon today, yet at the time, blood-sports like these were often seen to be a form of entertainment. Keeping this in mind, it is no wonder the company chose to record such a topic on celluloid in order to promote this violence. Proof of the popularity this film gathered is obvious right in the title; to know that this film is ""No. 2"" automatically suggests there was a No. 1, originally titled ""The Cock Fight"". Furthermore, the fact that the negatives of this original short wore out from having too many copies made also tells us how much in demand for prints the Kinetoscope parlors were. Lastly, the additions of the men betting and the white background (both of which were not in the original, which had a black background) show how the company attempted to further improve their earlier efforts, in addition to keeping the demands for prints met.

Still, I do not believe that the company meant that much harm when they contributed to non-moral topics at the time. Outside the fact they knew how popular the sport was and were eager to make money off it, I believe there was another reason they chose this particular topic to shoot: the constant amount of action. I hate to go into details, but think about it: the way the two birds peck and nip at each-other so quickly, the way their wings flap around and all of that whirlwind activity. In the early motion picture business, it was not story that mattered; it was whether or not they could awe audiences with the biggest amount of action in frame. (Nowadays, of course, it's the exact opposite: now we care more about plot and suspense then we do about action onscreen). In filming a cockfight, twice the amount of action is administered to the scene then you'll see in Lumière's movies. The fact that Georges Méliès did his own version of the Cockfight idea five years later (in 1899's ""A Lively Cock Fight""), where he billed it as ""without doubt the liveliest and best, being full of action"", also tells us there was a certain photographic value in the subject.

But I could be wrong. For all we know the people who call Edison a horrible person could be right, maybe he was just a jerk who enjoyed watching cruelty to animals. (Don't forget the company's production of ""Rat Killer"" from the same year). I haven't the slightest idea at all, but we can at least credit this and its predecessor to be the first films featuring live cocks.",1M

Like a good many of the early Edison movies, this one features a popular vaudeville performer of the time. Luis Martinetti's act combined acrobatic skill with a surprising ability to bend and twist himself into unexpected positions. He does these in the movie with a minimum of props, and while it's not really all that exciting, you can see that it's not easy to do.

This is one case in which filming in the studio with the very dark background works well, highlighting the performer while still allowing him what he needs for his act. The framing is good, and the occasional jumps in the footage may not have been there originally. The pace of Martinetti's movement seems to vary, but it's difficult to tell whether that was actually his pace, or whether the camera may simply have been cranked at different speeds.",1M

(The other one, not to be confused with this one, is ""Sioux Ghost Dance""of the same year). Together, both films helped make up a much bigger output of a series of movies starring performers from Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show, of which this routine was no doubt part of. Reportedly, this series of Wild West performance acts (including sharpshooter Annie Oakley, show manager Buffalo Bill and others) was not only used to promote the show further in America, where it had already become quite popular, but Europe in addition, where film distribution was beginning to blossom. (I assume these movies were among the first Kinetoscope shows shown in Europe at the time; it would not be until a year or so later when Robert Paul would introduce the invention further in England). The performance here starring native Americans Hair Coat, Parts His Hair, and Last Horse is not only of true Indians, it also provides a glimpse into the rituals and dances frequently performed by the Sioux at the time. In this case, the short dance routine was probably a ritual performed by warriors or hunters before going hunting their prey, as a sort of superstition that the 'spirits' they believed it (whoever they were) would bring them success. In that sense, it's interesting to watch this type of thing to get a sense about the Indian rituals of the time period.

Additionally, while both films tend to be put together in their own special grouping since both feature native Americans, there is no doubt plenty of difference between the two. In the case of ""Sioux Ghost Dance"", the performance filmed includes a larger variety of Indians, from small children to older adults. Little recognition of the camera seems to take place, and as a result of the amount of performers, none of them appear to have any space to move around in. With ""Buffalo Dance"", the performers are warriors; there are only three of them, thus giving them more space to move in, and an additional detail of a drummer providing accompaniment in included. One of the most interesting aspects of this particular short is not the costumes or the dance itself, but the way the youngest Indian stares the camera down, smiling in the most amusing way as if someone told a joke or as if he thinks everything's just a big put-on.

This particular routine performed by the Indians was no doubt only among the many acts they did as part of the show. Edison probably neglected to film some of the more active performances put on by the natives, such as hunting, horse-riding contests and other various feats of skill. Either way, to see real Indians from over a hundred years ago is a blessing in itself, since today films like these serve as historical artifacts more than entertainment because of being the only known filmed records of native American life. Certainly this would make it worth watching.",1M16S

It's an early Edison movie that shows variety artist Hadji Cheriff doing some crazy moves. It's hard to tell what he is actually doing and it's all just basically him jumping and swirling around. Appearantly there is a knife involved with all of this but I couldn't really see this at all.

With these type of early movies it was also the intention to cash in on it. Instead of letting people go to the theaters and carnivals for this sort of things, Edison and company attempted to bring the entertainment to the people with his short movies. These early movies also serve as a test for this, to see how well it all looks and what can and can't be done on film.

Hadji Cheriff almost jumps out of the screen a couple of times and he seems to have an hard time staying in the middle of the shot. I don't know if this is true but they also have seemed to mess a bit with the movie its frame rate. It's almost as if this movie is being played in slow-motion. For basically all of their sport related subjects, the Edison studio's, shot with 30 fps, while for their other, 'normal' everyday subjects, they used 20 or less. No idea if they actually attempted to create a slow-motion effect but fact is that all of the movements don't really flow that well and don't seem very fluent. Perhaps it would had worked out better all if the movie had been longer than its 19 seconds. There is now a clear beginning movie but there is no clear ending to it all. The movie just cuts off, while Hadji Cheriff is still in the middle of some moves.

In my opinion this just isn't a very interesting subject, though it's still interesting to see how people were entertained by several different variety artists and their acts, over an hundred years ago. As a test it doesn't seem like a very successful or influential one because of its subject and how it eventually turned out to look. Still they must had liked something about it, since they would use Hadji Cheriff years later again for one of their short movies; ""Arabian Gun Twirler"".

Just not good or interesting enough in my opinion.

Appereantly the native American's in this movie were part of Buffalo Bill's Wild West show but indeed they were real Sioux Indians. They are in full war paint and costume and show of one of their dances. We see how they start out, dance around a bit before the movie suddenly comes to an end.

It got not shot on location but in the Black Maria studio, with William Heise behind the camera, on September 24, 1894. The same day other similar type of movies got shot, featuring natives.

They were probably interesting in capturing the complicated movements of several people at the same time and distributed for the people to have a change to see actual Indians doing their stuff. It's quite good quality all and all of the movements seem smooth and natural. The movie got definitely shot in the right speed.

Only really relevant or interesting if you are into movie history or that of native American Indians.

In their earliest camera tests, boxing was a frequent subject they used for mock demonstrations performed by amateurs; the genre had given rise when some of the most famous boxers of the day got called to the Black Maria studio to be filmed (such as Mike Leonard, Jack Cushing and James Corbett); and now, having run out of popular boxers, the company was forced to shoot matches between little-remembered champions. Murphy (his last name hasn't been put in the record), appears to be in this case the underdog, with Hornbacker probably being the championship boxer since his full name is documented. Additionally, while only one round survives there was probably originally five or six; and once more, from the footage here, their isn't any way to know who won.

The Edison company would eventually drop the boxing genre by 1895, with their last known recorded match (at least to my knowledge) to have been ""Billy Edwards and the Unknown"". I've got no proof or anything, but I could at least say that the reason this was so was probably because more companies (like Lumière) had started shooting subjects on location and the black backgrounds of the Black Maria were getting a little tiresome. By 1896, this was finally the case with Edison too, some prime examples being ""Shooting the Shoots"" and ""Mess Call"", both of that year.",1M

There was Louis le Prince, who had created the world's first known celluloid film (and thus the first true motion picture, unless you count a bunch of photographs put together a 'moving picture'). There was Edison studios, who had created the first movies in the United States, (and who also wanted to prove themselves the inventors of the motion pictures, period). Then, there was Etienne-Jules Marey, a little-known Frenchman and filmmaker who started his career as a scientist and studier of animals. Long before Marey had bothered to attempt filming of the some of the first moving pictures, he was actually a photographer quite similar to Eadweard Muybridge in the sense that he also pioneered in motion pictures by still images, using animals and nude models for subjects to photograph. It was not until later in his career in photography that Marey succeeded where Muybridge didn't: it was he who became one of the earliest true filmmakers.

""Falling Cat"" was shot using Marey's chronophotographic gun, a camera of sorts resembling a shotgun. Using this invention, Marey thus conducted his most well-remembered experiment, performed at the Bois de Boulogne public park in France: to prove, once and for all, whether or not cats always land on their feet when dropped. (Of course, this will no doubt bring to mind Muybridge's attempts at discovering whether a horse becomes air-born when galloping, another reason why the two are very similar to each-other). To conduct the experiment, the cat was accordingly dropped upside down from the top of the frame, and is shown to twist around in mid-air before landing safely on a cushion at the bottom of the frame.

Arguably, this short experimental film is also believed to have been the earliest film to feature a cat, and thus the earliest LOLcat video on YouTube. While I would say that's not far from the truth, there's no way of knowing for sure: don't forget the Edison company shot ""Boxing Cats"" the same year. The latter could be considered a LOLcat more than this one could, in the sense it includes funnier action; but until filming dates for both films are found, I don't believe there's any way to figure out for sure whether or not this claim can be considered correct.",1M

In 1894, the Lumiere-family men [father: Antoine (1840-1911), sons: Auguste and Louis] owned and managed a factory that manufactured photographic plates and paper.  Not a small enterprise; the factory had more than 200 employees who received pension and social security benefits - innovative for that time.  It was located at Montplaisir in the suburbs of Lyon, France.  What caused Louis Lumiere to become interested in building a Cinematagraph, in 1894, remains open for speculation.  My suggestion is that the appearance of the Edison organization's Kinetoscope (peep-show machine), in Paris during the fall of 1894, provided the catalyst.

W.K.L. Dickson, of Edison's staff, invented a motion-picture camera about the size of an upright piano that was patented in February 1893.  It was electrically operated (using power from from heavy storage batteries.  This massive machine pumped celluloid film strip (newly developed by the Eastman company) past a lens at about 40 frames-per-second (fps).  It was ensconced, as an almost immovable object, in the ""Black Maria"" (essentially the first movie studio.)  The Kinetescope machines showed staged presentations (less than one-minute long)that were filmed in this studio.

During 1894, Louis Lumiere applied himself to the task of inventing a moving-picture camera.  He had determined that, even at 16 fps on celluloid film, the persistence-of-vision of the human eye/brain would allow for normal motion to be perceived.  His camera, dubbed the Cinematograph, was about the size of a large shoe box and was provided with a detachable film magazine that provided storage for enough film to make a shoot last about one minute when it was had cranked past the lens at 16 fps.

The size and light weight, of the camera (it could be converted into a printer or a projector by the addition of a light source) made it portable enough that it could be taken to any location to record an event (provided there was enough sunlight available.)  In the spring of 1895, Louis filmed: trick-riding by some cavalry men; a house on fire with firemen arriving and dousing the engulfed building with water; and a number of other scenes in and around Lyon.  Using a Molteni bulb, he turned the camera into a projector and presented his films to scientists assembled in the reception room of the Revue Generales des Science.  The images were projected on a screen five-meters distant from the lens.  The screen was stretched in a doorway between two rooms.  At a meeting of professional photographers, that same year, Louis photographed the arriving delegates and the same evening showed them motion pictures of their arrival.

With accolades from both the scientific and photographic communities, Louis decided to have a public exhibition of his invention by the end of the year. Since each of his films would be about one-minute long, he would need at least a dozen films to make a good presentation.  For one of these films he set up his camera at the entrance to his factory, photographing the egress of employees at quitting-time.

The public venue chosen by Antoine - who offered himself as the ""fairground barker"" for the Cinematograph - was the Salon Indien of the Grand Cafe on the boulevard des Capucines in Paris.  It was a wintry Saturday night on 28 December, 1895.  As the first audience sat, they were presented with a projected view of the exterior of the Lumiere factory (with closed gates.) Some were chagrined that they were just going to see a routine slide show of Lumiere photographs.  But then the crank on the camera/projector was turned and movement began.  Louis had an innate sense for motion picture taking. This film has a beginning, a middle and an end.  In the beginning, the doors are opened and people begin to leave their workplace; during the middle, the people stream out - with many trying to ignore the camera, and the cameraman, as they seem to be happy to leave a day of labor behind them.  At the end, the gates to the factory are being closed.

And this was the first film projected for the entertainment of the general public.",1M

It is an answer to Marx,a throwing down of the gauntlet. 

 Some roustabouts are standing with sledgehammers and no idea of what to do: typical of the working class.  At the command of the gang boss -- representing, as he does, the capitalist, who knows what he wants and will achieve it while paying his worker what the invisible hand of the economy will permit -- the workers, previously unmotivated, lift their hammers and destroy the wall.

The wall, the Marxian theoretician will have us believe, represents some useful function of society.  The twisting of things to the service of propaganda is apparent.  The wall represents evil, a separation among society.  Only through work, directed by the capitalist, will walls be destroyed and all profit.

But there is more.  The auteur retreats one step and runs the movie in reverse! At the command of capital, labor can make or unmake a wall. Clearly labor has no voice in the process.  All direction comes from the capitalist.",1M

aka The House of the Devil

Early Georges Melies trick film has a bat appearing inside a castle when it then transforms into the Devil himself. Soon this creature is using spells to make other creatures come to life. LE MANOIR DU DIABLE is going to be a big interest to those Melies die-hards such as myself but I think horror fans will also get a real kick out of this. To say this isn't one of the earliest examples of a horror film would be rather crazy because not only do we get the Devil and black magic but there are also ghosts, a skeleton and various other ghastly images. When viewed against today's technology I'm sure there are some that might laugh at these effects but once you consider these were being done in 1896 you really can't help but applaud them. Melies was clearly years ahead of everyone else and the effects still hold up quite well today. I really loved how the different people began to appear even though the editing effects are quite obvious. Another nice touch was some of the black comedy thrown in and for just one example check out how the skeleton is used. Another major plus is that Melies plays the main character so well and with such energy.",3M

This isn't just a mundane static scene about guys playing cards, it's a cheerful, enjoyable look into a bygone era.

At the beginning of Méliès's career, he had not yet innovated movie magic. He still had yet to 'discover' the film edit (which had already been innovated the year before by Alfred Clark). So his earliest films basically were just remakes of the Lumière Brothers' movies, which basically showed people mounting horses, people eating dinner, trains arriving in stations, and gentlemen playing cards. (This movie is a remake of the Lumiere Bros' ""Card Party""). Only seven films made by Méliès in 1896 survive; many of his early actualities do not and are largely forgotten. Of course, because of how simplistic it is, this film has no real significance except for the fact it was the director's first. It is still an entertaining watch, despite the lack of special effects.

This short is also one of the somewhat rare instances where almost all the actors in the film are identified.

You had the boxing films, scandalous enough already considering how illegal the sport was at the time; you had cockfights, a despicable sport similar to bullfighting; you had dancers like Annabelle Moore showing their ankles and belly-dancing, etc. And what did they do to demonstrate the first use of film editing? They reenacted the beheading of Mary Stuart. So it's no surprise that when it came to picking a scene from the famous Broadway musical ""The Widow Jones"", they of course chose the kissing bit. Today, it's a fairly innocent kiss, not a romantic movie star kiss, not a quick peck, just a sweet little display of affection. Unfortunately, such displays of affection, famous Broadway musical or not, just weren't acceptable at the time--and as result of the film's release, there were cries of censorship.

This was one of several W.K.L Dickson experimental films meant only to test the kinetoscope and the different motion capture techniques, it was never supposed to be seen by an audience instead it was a way to learn how to do the movies that, starting on 1893, were shown to people. However years after it was made its images were recovered and today it can be seen on the Internet.

Fencing was one of four sports films made that year, of those it is the only one I've been able to locate, but all of them had something in common, they were the first movies filmed on a 35mm. format that would later become the standard in the industry. On the other hand I have to highlight that it is the shortest film I've ever seen, in order to really appreciate it you have to run it several times, but that's not a problem, you'll see it 15 times in 15 seconds and you will still have a quarter of a minute to do with it whatever you please, so there's really no reason to miss this. the few remaining photogram shows us two fencer face to face, the one at the left has his weapon up and he's waiting, his rival starts on a rest position but then moves his sword up to meet his foe, at the same time he moves up his free arm to take a combat position. When the swords touch the film ends.

During movies history there has been many exciting sword fight scenes, specially in adventure movies, that makes it something very cinematographic and, while fencing as a sport has not been really showcased in movies, I think it is quite meaningful that one of the first sport films ever (boxing won by one year) has been starred by two sword men. Besides this interesting historic facts the film has not much to offer, so you must see it as a curiosity. The film falls short even by its time standards, by that year longer scenes were already captured so this falls short comparing it even with its contemporaries; but of course it was never meant to be seen.",1M

This provided the Lumière Brothers and Company the opportunity to pioneer how to compose shots, how to treat and direct the action within and outside of the frame and to decide the position of the camera. ""L' Arrivée d'un train"" was one of their more endearing examples of adroit framing, of positioning of the camera. To me, however, this film, a panorama of a canal in Venice, appears to be even more of a revelation, but seems to get historically lost among the company's many filmic innovations. It is simply a single tracking shot accomplished by placing the camera, tripod and cameraman in a gondola. As they stroll down the canal, the images of buildings, fellow navigators and such shift; the image changes with the mobile framing. This film is likely--has been credited as much by historians--the first to feature movement of the camera.

And, the man largely responsible for this innovation was Alexandre Promio. Supposedly, after witnessing the Lumière's films, he quit his job as an optician's assistant and took to making films for the Lumière Company. He travelled the world and, in the process, helped introduce cinema to the world.

The original novelty of moving pictures, that which distinguished it from other art forms, was merely that it reproduced motion. Until this film and others like it, the framing in films could just as well be done in painting or still photography. This was also at a time before films consisted of multiple shots and scenes. This was largely for technological reasons; the Latham Loop, which relieves pressure on the film and, thus, allows for more editing and longer pictures, had not yet become a standard piece of equipment. Now, however, there was the motion of the camera in addition to the motion of the subject, making the art form of cinema more unique--creating endless possibilities down the river.

Following this film, the Lumière Company produced various panoramas, affixing the camera to boats, trains, even a rickshaw. In America, reportedly beginning with ""The Haverstraw Tunnel"" (1897), the phantom rides began, which generally involved positioning the camera on the front of a train--giving audience's the point-of-view of the train, as it and you passed through the scenery, through tunnels and alongside mountain cliffs.

This short actuality film, ""Panorama du Grand Canal vu d'un bateau"", is available as part of the ""The Lumière Brothers' First Films"" (1996), which I highly recommend. In that film compilation, narrator Bernard Traverneir relates a story about this film. Supposedly, Promio was afraid that Louis Lumière would be upset with this innovation and apologized in a letter. Lumière, however, was impressed and instructed all of his globe-trotting cameramen to do panoramas. ""Panoramas"" was his preferred word for it, which was an apt word choice, indeed. ""A picture rolled out before the spectator's eyes.""

Back in 1896 it was excusable--after all, Méliès hadn't yet 'discovered' (as some people like to believe) the film edit or any of the special effects you see in later works of his. By 1898, however, he was well aware of this...so why was he still doing things like putting cameras on trains?

Part of this could have been he had not yet realized all the stuff he could produce using this simple editing concept. Like others of the time, he was still playing with the invention, trying new things... In this case, the camera is on top of the train, not at the front of the locomotive like other Phantom Ride films of the time (a Phantom Ride being a view from on top of a train as shot by the camera). Likely he hadn't yet tried such a gimmick yet. It would take a bit longer for him to realize the potential of the substitution splice.

This movie still retains some interest for at least film historians because it's one of the few rare documentary films by the director that still survives today. Many of his earlier, 1896 and 1897 documentaries cease to exist. That said, it's hard to understand exactly how film historians are able to identify this as being a Méliès short since so many similar movies were made at the time by just about everybody else.

Dickson and the Lumière brothers, whose influential discoveries and inventions set the basis for what we now know as cinema. Dickson's Kinetoscope was the first motion picture devise that became popular, and after its release in 1894 introduced moving images as a widely popular entertainment for the audiences of its time. Those early Kinetoscope films weren't exactly like the movies we know today as they weren't really fictional stories, the first short films were mostly shootings of mundane events or entertainment acts such as acrobats, circus performers and sport events. Among the many Kinetoscope films of those years, the most popular were the ones about female dancers performing an exotic and often sensual dance. Ella Lola would be the star of two of those films.

In this movie, dancer Ella Lola performs a Turkish variation of a ""danse Du Ventre"", the oriental belly dance. In her dance she shakes, twists and turns around in a very energetic dance. The elements of Turkish folklore can be felt despite the lack of sound as the differences from this and other belly dances are very notorious when her traditional Turkish dress swings in a marvelous way as she dances. Unlike other films about exotic dances, Lola's movies (the other was ""Ella Lola, a la Trilby"") were of a less erotic nature and more focused on the realistic representation of the dance. A professional dancer since a very young age, Lola's dancing is very graceful and showcases an enormous control over her body. Sadly, it can't be known who was behind the direction and cinematography (which is very good) of the movie, as by those years both Dickson and Heise, Edison's main Kinetoscope filmmakers, were working for a different company.

Ella Lola's two performances on film had the misfortune of being released when the days of this kind of movies were practically over. While her performance in this movie is excellent, and her faithfulness to the traditional dance is remarkable, when the movie was released the days of the popularity of this kind of movies were almost over. It wasn't only that the Kinetoscope was losing against the projected motion pictures invented by the Lumière brothers, cinema itself was changing. Filmmakers were discovering new uses for the medium and now film wasn't only used for the mere reproduction of entertainment events, it was now the source of its very own kind of entertainment. Dances on film had no chance against the French movies the Lumières and Georges Méliès, so films like the ones by dancers like Ella Lola, no matter how good the performances were, became the sub-genre's last dance. 6/10",1M

It does not work as well as their finest and best-known films did, although it does reflect some of the usual strengths that you expect from the Lumière features.

The ""Arab cortège"" of the title is only one of many things going on in this bustling Geneva street scene. The street is filled with numerous others, who themselves appear to be from a variety of backgrounds, plus a number of well-dressed onlookers who are watching everything else. There is also a building in the background that features a rather obscure sign, and it would be interesting to know just what kind of building it was.

A similar kind of complicated, cosmopolitan scene was captured beautifully in Lumière's ""Leaving Jerusalem By Railway"". This one is not up to that standard. In part, the jumbled picture that it catches is a result of the vantage point of the camera, which makes it hard to distinguish any part of the action from the rest of it. It also seems very likely that at least some of the action was unplanned, and whatever shot the camera crew had intended may have been disrupted by natural activity in the street.

It's still an interesting scene - as another commentator has mentioned, who would have expected Geneva in the 1890s to look like this? And it does manage to capture quite a bit of action in a restricted and stationary camera field. That it does not really seem very good compared to other Lumière features probably speaks to their own high standards, and possibly to the role of the unexpected in early film-making.",1M

Méliès's earlier films ""A Terrible Night"" (Une nuit terrible) and ""A Nightmare"" (Le cauchemar) (both 1896) established the outlines of a man's rest being interrupted, but here is the earliest available instance where he is at an inn, and the entire room seems to conspire against his restful night's sleep.

This was done by both theatrical and cinematic tricks. For instance, a splice of the filmstrip made a chair disappear as he tries to sit down, while his boots are pulled away on strings. These movements, appearances and disappearances of his clothing and the room's furniture end up driving the man to run out of the room in terror. Additionally, it shouldn't be overlooked how much Méliès's own performances in front of the camera added to the amusement of these productions.

This weary traveler at an inn genre was employed again in such Méliès's films as ""Going to Bed Under Difficulties"" (1900), ""The Inn Where No Man Rests"" (1903) and ""The Black Imp"" (1905) with variations on this theme in ""A Roadside Inn"" (1906) and ""The Diabolic Tenant"" (1909). Other filmmakers were quick to imitate and improve upon these films, as well, including Edwin S. Porter's ""Dream of a Rarebit Fiend"" (1906) and J.

The poor Cinderella gets a visit from her fairy godmother but the fun ends at midnight. There were earlier versions of this classic story but who better to bring it to life than George Melies? Melies brings his normal magic to the film and the special effects are pretty good. The highlight of the film is during the beginning when the godmother shows up and for a brief second we get some hand colored sequences. The coloring here is a lot better than what we've seen from this period. Since the film only runs five minutes not all of the story gets shown but the director does a good job at filling the screen with all the high points of the story.

A magician and his assistant perform numerous magic acts.,N/A,illusionist,915,10.0,1.0,6.4,jluis1984,2007-05-09,"French film pioneer Georges Méliès began his career as a filmmaker in 1896, just a few months after watching motion pictures for the first time in his life. Being a stage magician himself, he quickly noticed the enormous potential the new invention had as a form of entertainment, and immediately after the show made an offer to buy the Lumières' Cinématographe. The brothers refused, but that didn't stop Méliès, who decided to make his own devises based on the brother's work and the Bioscope camera. Soon he was making his own short movies, and while at first he copied the themes the Lumières had in their actuality films, he also started to make short fiction movies, often comedies and fantasy films. His movies would become legendary when he started to use his discoveries in the field of special effects in his films, earning himself the nickname of ""Cinemagician"" due to the spectacular effects of his fantasy tales.

While famous for his tales of fantasy, horror and science fiction, many of Méliès' early films were shorts about him, the magician, making an impossible trick on camera. ""L' Impressionniste Fin De Siècle"" (literally, ""The Impressionist of the End of the Century"", although better known as ""A Turn of the Century Illusionist""), is one of those short movies, as the film is about a magician (Méliès) making a supernatural trick of disappearance. First, the magician makes a doll come to life to be his assistant (probably his wife), and then makes her to vanish in thin air. Then, the magician lifts a barrel that he has on a table and the woman appears inside. After that, the magician turns his assistant into confetti before covering himself with the same magic blanket he used before. But that's not all, after the magician disappears, a series of fantastic tricks transformations will take place as the magician is able now to transform himself into his assistant.

Across his career, Méliès made many of this kind of ""gimmick films"", both to test his own tricks and to add some variety to his screenings. As one of those movies, ""L' Impressionniste Fin De Siècle"" is entirely based on the stop trick to make the illusion of things transforming and vanishing. It is certainly not the most sophisticated of his many tricks, but among his early films it is in this movie where his stop trick looks the best. In 1899 it was definitely a complicated trick to do at high speeds, but Méliès achieves a very fluid work of editing that allows him to use it even when his characters are running and jumping without looking too fake. The effects of the many disappearances, done in his purest stage magician style, are still amazing even now, more than 100 years after the shooting of the movie.

""L' Impressionniste Fin De Siècle"" is probably not the most impressive of the Cinemagician's films, but like most of his movies, it carries that special something, that magic that makes them so fun to watch. 1899 would be an important year of many changes for Méliès, as it was that year when he released his classic, ""Cendrillon"" (""Cinderella""), and started his most popular period. Both as an experiment and as a charming entertainment, ""L' Impressionniste Fin De Siècle"" is a very successful film and offered a glimpse of what the Cinemagician had in the bag. 7/10",1M

Men are magically created and transformed in order to create a human pyramid.,N/A,N/A,218,10.0,1.0,5.3,F Gwynplaine MacIntyre,2007-11-05,"I saw this film in October 2007 at Le Giornate del Cinema Muto in Pordenone, Italy. The festival screened a brand-new acetate print, specially struck from an original nitrate print which has miraculously survived since 1899, and which is now archived at Filmoteca de Catalunya in Barcelona.

This film's title -- 'The Pyramid of Triboulet' -- is a mystery to me. Triboulet was of course a character in a Victor Hugo story which became the inspiration for the opera 'Rigoletto'. The word 'triboulet' is also a generic term for a court jester dressed entirely in red. In this movie -- one of Georges Melies's 'trick' films -- we indeed have a (human) pyramid, but no triboulet that I noticed.

Melies himself appears costumed as a wizard. He opens a steamer trunk, and produces from it a whole series of male athletes, one at a time. When the trunk is finally empty, the athletes form a human pyramid. After they break the pyramid, Melies transforms them into elegantly-dressed ladies!

As usual for Melies, the magic tricks are achieved with a jump cut. Although these tricks undoubtedly astounded cinema audiences in 1899, 21st-century audiences are now far too jaded to marvel at a camera trick which has been done more skilfully in 'Bewitched' and 'Lost in Space'. Having worked with circus performers and acrobats, I was more impressed here by the human pyramid, which involves no camera trickery: it's a genuine gymnastic feat, performed honestly and expertly.

Melies shows some cleverness in transforming these male athletes into female fashion plates ... but again, this is just one more jump cut. More than 60 years after this film was made, Monty Python's Flying Circus used the same gimmick to turn a group of Mr Gumbies into women and then back again. More for that human pyramid than for any other reason, I'll rate this minor Melies entry 5 out of 10.",1M

Yes, we've seen Hollywood show us what 1899 looked like and they've shown us people in cowboy hats and walking the streets of a small town but this here is real.

A man is wining and dining a young lady only to wake up beside an old shrew who gives him what for.  The master of this dream/reality narrative is Buster Keaton, who developed it with heartbreaking inventiveness.

This film is not without interest though.  Firstly, the dream sequence is excellently imagined, with the couple dining in the foreground and a blank background creating a suitably unreal effect.  The symmetry between couples is effective, suggesting that the wife may once have been like this one, asking us to ponder the processes that led to her 'decline', even the possibility of the husband's malign influence. Of course, this symmetry is actually a representation of rupture, division, disharmony - between dream and reality, the ideal and the mundane, the young and the old, the unattainable and the attainable.

The strange thing about the dream is that, firstly, the woman is unattainable in it, she flirts, but she doesn't give herself; secondly, she is dressed in a costume reminiscent of the circus or carnival.  Here the dream is something subversive, something that can critique the failures, the repressions, the dissatisfactions of real life.  It also points to the use most people make of the cinema, to dream about better lives than our own, lives we can see but cannot have.  It is this melancholy vein that helps the film transcend misogyny.",1M

The idea is a simple one, but by no means an easy one to carry off using the resources of the time. Méliès also adds a few interesting details to the high-quality camera tricks.

The same idea was used later on by other silent screen comedians, most notably by Buster Keaton in his wonderful feature, ""The Playhouse"". This much earlier movie is quite a bit simpler, but considering its era it is almost as impressive. Méliès plays a band-leader and each member of the band, using multiple exposures and other carefully crafted special effects to create an amusing scene.

As Méliès gained even more experience, his features often added lavishly detailed settings to the fine visual effects. This 1900 movie relies mostly on the central idea, without too much background detail, but his technique is already excellent, and this is one of many entertaining Méliès features that demonstrate his considerable creativity and skill.",2M

Méliès fills its short running time with a barrow load of comic invention. We have women morphing into men; a man having his head and limbs knocked off and reassembled; and a fellow who is flattened like a pancake. What this movie shows, apart from Méliès mastery of visual trickery, is his sense of humour and comic timing.

This French movie was released in 1902 and represents a revolution for the time, given its length (around fourteen minutes), as compared to the more common two-minute short films then being produced.

A Trip to the Moon directly reflects the theatrical personality of its director, Georges Méliès, whose past as a theater actor and magician influenced the making of the movie. The film boldly experiments with some of the most famous cinematic techniques, such as superimpositions, dissolves, and editing practices that would be widely used later on. Despite the simplicity of its special effects, the film is generally considered the first example of science-fiction cinema. It offers many elements characteristic of the genre - a spaceship, the discovery of a new frontier - and establishes most of its conventions.

Méliès's movie deserves a legitimate place among the milestones in world cinema history. Despite its surreal look, A Trip to the Moon is an entertaining and groundbreaking film able to combine the tricks of the theater with the infinite possibilities of the cinematic medium. Méliès was an orchestrator more than a director; he also contributed to the movie as a writer, actor, producer, set and costume designer, and cinematographer, creating special effects that were considered spectacular at the time. The first true science-fiction film cannot be missed by a spectator looking for the origin of those conventions that would later influence the entire genre and its most famous entries.

In a more general sense, A Trip to the Moon can be regarded as the movie that established the major difference between cinematic fiction and nonfiction. At a time when filmmaking mostly portrayed daily life (such as the films of the Lumière brothers at the end of the 19th century), Méliès was able to offer a fantasy constructed for pure entertainment. He opened the doors to future film artists by visually expressing his creativity in a way utterly uncommon to movies of the time.",13M

No one had really worked out how to tell stories via this new medium. It was left to the ultimate cinematic innovator Méliès to start thinking of film as a narrative form. And with this little movie we have a definite story; one which is also replete with the director's famed visual invention. It's one of the first times that he utilised his special effects into an actual story. There are several different sets, all of which have detailed design. The story itself is about the evil character Bluebeard. It's a much more macabre subject than Méliès more common fantasy based tales. This one still has those elements too but also has darker, more nightmarish content. In its most memorable moment, for instance, the heroine enters a secret room where the dead bodies of Bluebeard's seven previous wives hang. It's quite striking and one of the earliest examples of horror cinema.

It didn't instantly create the Western genre; instead, it was part of and led to a spew of crime pictures--a genre begun in England. (G.M. ""Billy Bronco"" Anderson, who was somewhat of an assistant director on the film, would largely invent the movie Western a few years later after leaving the Edison Company, however.) Although the plot isn't very exciting today, the film remains a landmark in film history--mostly for its narrative structure. It's also notable how matter-of-fact, ""realistic"" and violent the film is for its time--being detailed and rather objective in its following of the details of the crime (what Neil Harris calls ""an operational aesthetic""). The story film was already established by 1903 but was still in its infancy. Filmmakers were still experimenting with how to tell a narrative, and Porter was one of early film's greatest innovators, as well as an astute student of film.

Throughout his film-making career, Porter was strongly influenced by contemporary British and French films, which he would have ready access to since the Edison Company regularly duped them. His ""Uncle Josh at the Moving Picture Show"" is a rip-off of Robert Paul's ""The Countryman and the Cinematograph."" ""The Gay Shoe Clerk"" is a revision of George Smith's ""As Seen Through a Telescope."" Porter also introduced intertitles to American cinema in ""Uncle Tom's Cabin,"" having seen them in some of Smith's films. ""Life of an American Fireman"" reflects James Williamson's ""Fire!"" The temporal replay in that film was influenced by Georges Méliès's temporal replay of the Moon landing in ""Le Voyage dans la lune."" ""Dream of a Rarebit Fiend"" also owes plenty to Méliès.

""The Great Train Robbery"" followed a recently created genre of crime and chase films begun in England. ""The Daring Daylight Robbery"" was especially of influence, as was, it is said by historians, a 1903 film called ""The Robbery of the Mail Coach."" ""The Great Train Robbery"" is also based on a play of the same title by Scott Marble. News of real train robberies also served as inspiration according to the Edison catalogue. Anyhow, with the exception of wholesale rip-offs, it's not discourageable that Porter learned from other films and adopted techniques and style from them for his own. He is worthy of history's praise for being such an avid student of film and one of the more active filmmakers of his time to develop film grammar.

Some film historians and critics say that Porter's work was uneven, that ""The Grain Train Robbery"" and perhaps one or two other films were a happenstance success, or fluke. Someone was bound to figure out the techniques of narrative as story films became more complex--confronting such problems as spatially separate actions and the continuity of action. I've seen a good share of Porter's work, however, and it's apparent that he was usually experimenting. He wasn't consistent like Méliès, which is good because his work becomes stale. Porter's previous experiments in editing resulted in this, his most accomplished story film and greatest success.

There are a few special effects in ""The Great Train Robbery,"" as others have mentioned. It's nothing new: double-exposure matte work for the shot of the train outside the window and for the outside of the moving train's door, hand coloring, in addition to stopping the camera and splicing to replace an actor with what is obviously a mannequin. Most amazing about this picture (for its time) are its structure and the editing and camera techniques employed for its continuity. Panning and tilting wasn't new, but this movement of the camera in one scene to follow the action is exceptional for 1903. Likewise, Porter and others had already used the close-up. Porter employed an insert of a fire alarm in ""Life of an American Fireman"" and a privileged camera position for ""The Gay Shoe Clerk."" The shock value of the close-up in this film even serves form as its entirety is supposed to thrill.

Furthermore, the view from on top of the train is quite good. The transitioning between interior and exterior shots is fluent, and generally so is the continuation of action from scene to scene, with action exiting and entering scenes from appropriate directions. This is elementary film-making now, but in 1903, they were inventing it.

What I think is the most interesting part of ""The Great Train Robbery,"" though, is its editing between the plot of the telegrapher and that of the robbers after their initial confrontation. After following the robbers for a while, the film cuts back to the ""meanwhile"" plot of the telegrapher. Initially, the barn dance scene doesn't appear to serve any narrative function--until the telegrapher enters to gather a posse. It's an interesting ordering of and transitioning between parallel actions. The plot isn't in temporal order, and it's a nice testament to Porter's innovation that a few modern viewers have been perplexed by how the posse catches up with the robbers so quickly.

It would take D.W. Griffith and others to build upon past work and their own in moving towards more entertaining and cinematic films, but the developments in narrative experimented with by pioneers like Porter paved the way.

(Note: This is one of four films that I've commented on because they're landmarks of early narrative development in film history. The others are ""As Seen Through a Telescope,"" ""Le Voyage dans la lune"" and ""Rescued by Rover."")",11M

The original film is probably lost forever. These two pictures must have been quite popular in their day. Smith essentially introduced the close-up to motion pictures in 1900 with ""As Seen Through a Telescope"" and ""Grandma's Reading Glass"", enhancing upon the medium close-up that had been quite popular since the Edison Company's ""The Kiss"" (1896). In Smith's two aforementioned films from 1900, the close-ups are point-of-view shots, with a mask around the camera lens to create circular vignettes. In ""As Seen Through a Telescope"", a man with a telescope looks at something, then the film cuts to a close-up of what he's looking at through the perspective of the telescope.

""Sick Kitten"" contains a similar one scene, three-shot structure. There's a long shot, or establishing shot, followed by a close-up and the end takes us back to the original long shot position. The close-up in this film, however, doesn't involve camera masking or any character's point of view. It's a standard (as we know it today) close-up. It's also a match on action shot. It's seamlessly done and creates a good continuity. The same year, Edwin S. Porter's ""The Gay Shoe Clerk"", which is a reworking of ""As Seen Through a Telescope"", used a similar three-shot continuity: two establishing shots with a close-up inserted in the middle. Smith took this idea further within the same year in what is probably his most advanced surviving film, ""Mary Jane's Mishap"". Films with multiple shots were nothing new by 1903, but the scene dissection on display in these films by Smith were quite rare. For comparison, the most popular film from 1903, ""The Great Train Robbery"", has multiple shots, but they are all scenes in themselves. Oh, ""Sick Kitten"" doesn't have much of a story itself--just a couple of kids feeding a sick kitten. The cut to the close-up occurs during the feeding.

It's a simple comic chase film, but it has good energy and a couple of funny ideas, with technical aspects that are of good quality for its time. It's one of a handful of James Williamson's films that survive, and like a number of the others it has a good dose of wit along with basic movie-making skill.

For all that some of the plot developments are pretty goofy, it is rather well-conceived in itself. The manic situation builds nicely, starting with the theft being committed, and going on from there. Including the dogs in the chase was a good idea that works well, and it provides an amusing take on crime, justice, and punishment. It probably also took some real ingenuity (and perhaps a little luck) to have the sequence with the dogs come out so well.

This is one of the very earliest 'chase films', and it has a lot of energy, plus a couple of good gag ideas that would hold up well enough even if they were used in a movie of a somewhat later era. It's not that hard to tell how old this movie is, but it still works pretty well, and is certainly worth seeing for those who enjoy watching these early movies.",2M

After he is left alone his candle begins to glide back and forth on the table, then it grows large and menaces him. (And I guess someone could write an essay about the symbolism ...) A ghostly, seductive girl appears and dances for him, but when he tries to embrace her she turns into a hideous crone. The story builds to a comic climax just before it ends.

The narrative is simple and easy to follow without the help of title cards. This film is brief but engaging, like a simple story told at a campfire.

The feature takes the ""Cake-Walk"" dance and uses it is the subject for a series of short dance numbers, some of which would almost look at home in an MGM musical, and others of which are enjoyably bizarre.

The trick of Melies throwing the clothes on the woman is something he's done in previous films but the trick still works well here.

The Egyptian setting is a nice touch and adds some exotic ambiance. The skeletal creature is manipulated in ways that are visually interesting.

Porter and the Edison Company's ""The Gay Shoe Clerk"" demonstrates the influence of British filmmaker George Albert Smith. This film is essentially a remake, or reworking, of Smith's ""As Seen Through a Telescope"" (1900); it uses the same three-shot plot, including a close-up in the middle, and the joke of a man being punished for looking at a woman's ankle while she lifts her dress. The setting was changed from a man outside using a telescope to view the leg in Smith's film to the inside of shoe store. Porter would've presumably seen Smith's film through the duping practices of the Edison Company, who stole Smith's film and distributed it as ""The Professor and His Field Glass"". Historian Charles Musser (""Before the Nickelodeon"") says that Porter may have also been influenced by a Biograph subject, tellingly titled, ""Don't Get Gay with Your Manicure"" (1902/03).

More interestingly are the differences between the close-ups in Porter and Smith's films. The one in ""As Seen Through a Telescope"" is a masked point-of-view (POV) shot. Porter's view is not masked and is not a POV from any character's perspective, but is an ordinary (""invisible"") close-up, matching-on-action, which isn't explained within the narrative, as a POV shot is. Standard film-making nowadays, but not in 1903. Yet, not even this use of the close-up was Porter's invention. The same fellow Smith had used the same kind of insert close-up in the middle of his three-shot film ""The Little Doctors"" (1901) (now a lost film), which he remade as ""Sick Kitten"" (1903). Additionally, Porter had previously inserted a close-up of a fire alarm being pulled in ""Life of an American Fireman"" (1903).

""The Gay Shoe Clerk"" is imitative, but not deplorable as were the dupes and shot-for-shot remakes also made by the Edison Company and other studios. It remains well made for 1903 and an amusing exploitation of cinema viewing's voyeuristic nature, with the punitive gag of the character being repeatedly hit for looking at the woman's leg, while we moviegoers get away unscathed.",1M

It might be projected, it might be a mask or it might be by removing a scrim.

The method of achieving this is not important: the inset image to show a character's thoughts was a standard of magic lanterns, largely supplanted by a wipe and either a change of color or focus in films.

Each scene is packed with details, so much so that you cannot even catch it all in one viewing.  It is also color-tinted in many places, which adds even more to the effect.  The story is just wild, and is less plausible than many Verne stories, but that does not detract from it as entertainment.

Cropping did not appear to interfere with the film, although it is hard to tell without titles.  This should give an idea of the technical quality of the release I watched.

This film was mainly done to show off a particular special effect.  A magician draws pictures on a chalkboard, and then his facial hair grows to fit the image he has drawn.  This is part magic act, part comic routine. It is amusing, but special effects are so common today that it is not amazing, as it must have been to the people who first viewed it.  Basically an image of the magician with one type of hair fades into an image of the same magician in the same position with another type of hair.  The quality of this special effect is fairly good, so it didn't seem cheap, just redundant.

My recommendation is to watch it if you are interested in very early film history.  It is a good example of a setup that is similar to a booth or simple theater show, but depicts something that could never be shown live.

Prior to the 1900's, his work in trick films and editing had largely consisted of innovations in the film edit, with acclaimed films such as ""The House of the Devil"", ""A Nightmare"" (both 1896), ""The Astronomer's Dream"" (1898), ""The Devil in a Convent"" (1899) and numerous others. Superimposition was the next great discovery in the filmmaker's career, including films as early as ""The Four Troublesome Heads"" (1898) and later ones like ""The Man With the Rubber Head"" (1901). The dissolve was really the final trick of significance in Méliès's body of work, done as early as 1899 for scene transitions but continuously being reproduced through a number of simple trick films to serve a similar function as would the film edit.

""The Imperceptible Transmutations"" is a quick two-minute exercise of the latter effect, and bears a significant resemblance to ""Fugitive Apparitions"" of the same year. In both, Méliès is a magician who performs a basic magic act, making appear his female assistant who he causes to then disappear and transform. The dissolves utilized are gradually done, flaws being, of course, that as the woman appears Méliès's posture will shift by accident, showing a clear dissolve from one image to the next. A hard thing to be helped, this, and evidence that shows that while a slow dissolve is pleasant and works well in many situations, a film edit is much more seamless and will not show such inconsistencies.

'Billy' Bitzer is usually remembered for his work on D.W. Griffith's epics, this short feature - a solo effort by Bitzer - might be an even more impressive display of his skill. To accomplish such clear, detailed photography of a moving underground subject, given the equipment of the time, must have taken considerable talent and planning.

The end effect seems straightforward in itself: the movie shows a view of a subway car, taken from another one, as it makes a trip through the tunnels under New York City. On a few occasions, another car carrying the lighting, running along a parallel track, can be glimpsed. But the timing, the coordination, the light level, and many other challenges involved make it a real achievement for its day.

The 'ride' effect itself is interesting for a while, at least for those of us with limited experience riding subways. There is not all that much to see, so that after a while it's mostly more of the same thing, but every detail that there is to see is rendered clearly.

It uses the kind of trickery perfected by Melies, but is arguably more potent because of its (relative) grounding in real life.

A well-to-do couple speed down a sunny country road, ordered to stop by an approaching pedestrian policeman.  They promptly, gloriously, run him over. As he gives chase, the motorists are blocked by a large building, which they drive up with exhilirating ease.  While the blundering bobby gazes in bafflement, the drivers zip through space, circling the moon, skating Saturn's rings, before running out of petrol, freefalling, and collapsing on a court-case that was at any rate degenerating into farce.

Although you can obviously see the joins, the inventiveness of this short holds up remarkably well, as it shows that cars are a nuisance off, as well as on the road.  The invention of the motor-car brought with it a greater mobility, a shortening of distances, in effect shortening time and space; as it became possible to travel to more places more quickly, the world became a smaller place.

Ditto the cinema, which could do so much more than the mere photographing of things - not only visiting new worlds, but creating them, inviting our imagination to soar above the mundane.  Unlike our own fantasy films, however, audiences then were not hypnotised into forgetting real life, the mendacious absurdity of our social institutions, the arbitrary ineptitude of our law enforcers - is it any wonder we might want to escape?

The film is treasurable for that glorious moment when the peeler, with doltish complacency, linked to the immemorial countryside as he attempts to control this new-fangled aberrance, is upended - thud! - against a steaming bonnet, the majesty of the law a sprawling punchline.",3M

It's also part of the London Australian Film Festival, likewise at the Barbican ... so, I actually ended up attending two film festivals simultaneously! The restored film is a double-bill with 'The Life Story of John Lee: The Man They Could Not Hang'.

'The Story of the Kelly Gang' is generally believed to be (and most likely WAS) the first feature-length movie ever made, produced in 1906. Sadly, the past tense is appropriate here, as the film is now not known to survive except in fragments ... and some of those do indeed appear to be out-takes, as a previous IMDb'er has noted. Actually, I've also seen (in Australia) another reel of this film: not a projection of the movie's image onto a screen, but rather I've seen (and touched) a mouldering reel of nitrate footage from the movie itself, now deteriorated beyond hope of restoration.

As a part-time Australian (born in Scotland, expatriated Down Under as a 'child migrant'), I ought to feel proud that Australia produced the first feature movie. However, quite enough films pre-dating 1906 survive (from various nations) to make it clear that a substantial amount of film technique -- the close-up, the dissolve, the cross-cut -- had already evolved before this movie was made. Watching this restoration at the Barbican, it occurred to me that credit for the single biggest innovation in 'The Story of the Kelly Gang' belongs not to the photographer, director, editor or scenarist, but rather to that most unsung of film figures ... old Smokey, the projectionist. Prior to 'The Story of the Kelly Gang', films were so short that it was possible to store two or more separate movies on one projection reel. And, each reel being a separate story, the breaks between reels were natural breaks in the narrative. Many early cinemas had only one projector, with live entertainment provided during the longeur while the previous reel was rewound before the next reel could be shown. However, when 'The Story of the Kelly Gang' was exhibited in its original form in Australia (and later in other countries), the projectionist had to maintain two sets of apparatus at the same go, so as to achieve a seamless transition between reels. I wonder how soon film editors began using a reel marker (traditionally in the frame's upper right-hand corner) to indicate that a reel was about to end.

Despite being largely missing in action, the original 'Story of the Kelly Gang' is of incalculable historic importance. As for the digital version which I enjoyed today, accompanied by Mr Sweeney's impressive performance on the keyboard, I'll rate it a full 10 out of 10. Bonzer, cobbers!",1H10M

Stuart Blackton's The Haunted Hotel, which, at the same time, Chomón would remake more ambitiously the following year under the title The Electric Hotel. These remakes were the norm back in those days; as a consequence, copyright issues would arise but, until then, life was all a bowl of cherries to filmmakers.

Blackton's film was so successful in Europe, Pathé ordered Chomón to make a version of it and, even though some of the scenes (especially the one containing food being served on the table all by itself) are copied frame by frame, it isn't fair to give all the credit to Blackton since Segundo de Chomón had released his La maison hantée a year before The Haunted Hotel appeared. Who should we thank then? Méliès again. A bunch of tourists being harassed by spirits at some inn was certainly a recurrent subject matter in his movies, take The Black Devil as an example.

Regarding this movie, the two first scenes (introducing the atmosphere) are quite impressive: it's raining, the trees move as the wind blows and rays were added to the print causing a really shocking effect. It does look like a hell of a night (which couldn't be easy to portray so well in silent films). Three travelers take shelter in a house by the woods in which every kind of funny thing is going to happen: a ghost appears, clothes begin to fly all of the sudden, a painting comes to life, the house starts shaking up and so on.

The copy I had the chance to view came from the Nederlands Filmmuseum and I must say it was pretty neat and very well conserved too. The effects are very successful, scary even to this day; performances are good too, but once again it lacks originality. Chomón was an expert in imitating things and even though he did not invent anything, he helped to develop some important techniques. His use of the stop-motion in this movie is amazing. This is a great film I could watch all over again and again.

He assisted Albert Capellani with the special effects in ""The Talisman"" of 1907; he worked as the cinematographer for Gaston Velle's ""The Rajah's Casket"" of 1906 and for Lucien Nougret's (who helped direct this) and Capellani's ""Sleeping Beauty"" of 1908. Don't forget the many stop-motion animation trick films which he produced for Pathé up until 1910, either. All boasted gorgeous sets, great stencil-coloring and other major pluses which were quite close in beating those of the Star films.

The difference between a Chomòn fantasy and a Méliès fantasy, though, is the cutting. As stated before, Méliès was strongly influenced by the stage productions of the period which are part of what helped him create the masterpiece ""A Trip to the Moon"" and the many other well-remembered shorts of the time. So, to make them seem like a stage production, Méliès filmed his biggest movies just like them--with big, long shots, no closeups, theatrical sets and lots of overacting. Largely, a lot of Pathé films during this period were like this too--but when Chomòn was in charge, the style took a different route. The shots were much closer to the actors, there were frequent uses of closeups and medium closeups and in general they seemed less theatrical. If you watch this film and compare it to Capellani's ""The Talisman"", you'll see a big difference--the latter being a more dated method of storytelling and the former remaining a more up-to-date style of filmmaking.

""The Obsession of Gold"" is indeed a fantasy, probably not adapted from a stage production, but certainly a fantasy nonetheless. The gesturing does remain a little theatrical, and the dancers in the fairy land are something you'd see Méliès doing, but the cutting is much more innovative. Take, for instance, the medium closeup of the painter playing with his money. This is definitely not something Méliès would have done because of how 'unnecessary' most filmmakers would have thought it at the time. In addition, the scene in the jeweler's shop continues to use this same technique of cutting--there is no long shot before it, oddly enough--yet it all shows a more advanced method. Still, Chomòn would only go so far with this type of filmmaking--and Griffith would eventually have to come in later and pick up where he had left off.

Unfortunately, the entire film does not survive; various sources online state the original film had a total of seven minutes, while the version available on the internet is only three minutes. This would explain the lack of a long shot in the jeweler's shop scene, and the fact the film is lacking continuity in several spots. To make matters worse, YouTube has two separate versions, one of which has only the opening in the painter's studio and which ends after the fairy appears. (The other reviewer has seen this version and would do well to see the more complete uploading). If you want to get the longer short I would advise you type in the french title, since the English title brings up the non-complete version. What does survive of this film is quite good, though, and a complete copy being discovered someday would be a great thing.",

The plot isn't really comprehensible. Some folks stand by and watch with a flower-bordered screen as all sorts of tableaux appeared and disappeared. And, in the end, two of the onlookers climb inside a giant flower and disappear. In between there is some pointless dancing.

The only thing that stands out for me positively is the color. The Pathé Brothers pioneered the use of stencils--whereby assembly lines of ladies hand-painted color onto each cel of the film!

While this is rare in his career, ""The Charmer"" is one of these ripoffs and bears a large resemblance to Méliès's ""The Brahman and the Butterfly"" from 1901. While made 6 years later, this film in undeniably an outright copy of the other film and while more elaborate in sets, costumes, and actors, this is inexcusable.

The film's set-up has a Brahman stuffing a giant caterpillar into a cocoon, which magically turns into a butterfly (in the Méliès original, the butterfly came out of the cocoon, but there's not much difference anyhow). Then, when he tries to catch her she makes more butterfly women appear (one of which had no wings but still pretended as though she had). The twist at the end is not new at all and it is pretty much what we saw before in the other film.

The main difference between the two is the fact that in the other film there was only one butterfly. Still not enough to make this one original. There's some nice coloring and costumes which make it a better production, and while it is a nice film to watch visually, it drags on a little too long and tends to pad certain parts--especially the butterflies flying around.

Julienne Mathieu (the director's wife) stars in this one. She walks out on a nice little stage and begins making giant eggs appear out of no where. Then, she opens each one to reveal dancers who do a nice little dance in costume.

De Chomon tries for an air of realism. His set's floor is covered with dirt; Melies' act is undercranked slightly to lend more vivacity to the movement; the print of de Chomon's work is colored more elaborately than comparable prints from Melies, being tinted brown (not sepia) and stenciled. The last may simply be a statement of which prints survived a hundred years. Both make extensive use of cuts in service of their transformations. Melies also uses lifts and wires, which creates a lot more movement. There's much more posing in this film, from the chorines holding fans to the magician lying on a divan.

It's the liveliness that makes the Melies films better. It wouldn't make much difference in the long run. Pathe, with their greater resources, including equipment manufacture and exhibition, could outspend Melies. Eventually, they would swamp him.",2M

His earliest works were short documentations of Spain (save a few more innovative shorts like ""Collision of Trains"" of 1902), proving himself a fine cinematographer and a wonderful film colorist; as he progressed in his career he learned of the great French director Georges Méliès, and attempted passionately to defeat him by surpassing his work without success. His earliest trick films sometimes were quite stagy, contained no new or different innovations in their tricks, and even occasionally were direct Méliès ripoffs--see ""The Charmer"" of 1907. In other words, he was only a copy-cat of his rival, and did not improve in any sense upon the work that came before him.

That lasted for the majority of his years working for Pathé, from 1901-1907. In 1908, something changed. He learned the art of stop-motion animation, and that was when he became much more innovative and influential. His films began to become more elaborate: instead of direct ripoffs and stagy magic trick shorts like his predecessor, he started incorporating closeups into his work, creating a much more elaborate film structure such as that Griffith would later pioneer. His stop-motion animation was utterly charming, utilized with good effect, and was something completely new that Méliès had never done before. And thus, with these new techniques on his side, he outdid the cliche stagy magic acts of his rival and brought those acts up to date.

""The Scullion's Dream"" is a particularly remarkable and notable film because of how these effects are utilized. Instead of using them as a magic show, they are here part of an insignificant little story--a story used to set up the effects, but one nevertheless. In this six minute work, a bunch of kitchen boys are at work in the kitchen, messing around whenever their boss is gone. A dwarf appears and causes to materialize a little potion, which all drink and causes everyone to fall asleep. The dwarf reappears and proceeding to chop off all their hands with a large butcher knife, the hands start doing the work they neglected--including cutting a cabbage, weaving a basket, stacking plates, etc. As pointed out by the other reviewers, the last bit--in which a fly draws on a man's bald scalp--is rather unnecessary but adds a certain amount of charm and sets up the final gag.

Reviewer boblipton says that because of this ""padding"" at the end--which also serves to place a copyright notice--the short is lesser than what Méliès had done years before. I think quite the opposite. To cut to closeups to display the animation is part of what makes this actually ahead of the French master. Closeups would become more and more frequent during the early 1910s, but during the 1900s, it was quite revolutionary. Furthermore, and as stated above, new illusions--ones unseen before and masterfully executed. It is quite sad that these illusions cannot be seen in their full glory, however--the surviving print is very scratched and whited out, very low quality and thus making certain details hard to see. Nonetheless, well-executed and quite different compared to the repetitiveness of Méliès's work, which was losing lots of popularity by this point in film history.",6M

Because of the fact the director released some of his most elaborately structured trick films that same year, with such works as ""The Scullion's Dream"", ""The House of Ghosts"" (sometimes inaccurately labelled as being from 1907), and in particular ""The Electric Hotel"", one might expect a more interesting and inventive setup for this film. Here, Chomón once again borrows the basic concept of a stage magic act--realized with special effects--off of his competition Georges Méliès, who by now was delving into slapstick comedies and melodramas in an attempt to catch up with the times. Because he was no doubt still selling prints of his movies, despite not making any new ones, Chomón here was obviously trying to bring an end to this market his competition had by rivaling him in producing better efforts.

However, just how much were these films being watched anymore? Why was the Spaniard trying to outdo something that was already quite old by this point? Only God knows. Chomón had entered the filmmaking business altogether too late to be of any huge significance, and he has largely been forgotten because of this. Audiences had gotten tired of gimmicks and were looking for more stories in films; by 1908 trick films like this were an outdated fad no one cared to invest in. While Chomón indeed had some unrecognized importance in how he brought these magic films up to date by incorporating closeups and stop-motion animation, this film surprisingly shows nearly none of that more innovative style that he was pioneering the same year. Thus, while this short has some good illusions and lovely stencil-coloring, it's safe to say that because of the most stagy feel to it, ""Japanese Butterflies"" was probably not a huge success.

The film, as another reviewer has pointed out, uses a motif of the director's which appeared in several other shorts from around that time: Oriental folk, particularly Japanese/Chinese. In it, a magician makes an assistant of his appear before wrapping her in tarp and setting her on fire--a trick seen in Chomón's film ""The Red Specter"" from the year before. A variety of other gimmicks also occur, such as some floating umbrellas and, predictably, butterflies. The highlight that makes the film is the end, where the director does bring it slightly up-to-date by cutting to a medium closeup to show a caterpillar being drawn on the chalkboard, which climbs in a cocoon and transforms into a butterfly. The color of the film is especially exercised at the end, where said butterfly changes colors, transforms into an actress with butterfly wings, and finally a serpentine dancer performing--which brings back some nostalgia for the popular dance movies of the 1890s.

The ending is apparently missing, since according to the Moving Picture World Synopsis it originally ended showing butterflies rising to Heaven. On top of that, there appears to have been more setup at the beginning of the film that's also unavailable, since the short begins right in the middle of some action. (I have no way of evidencing this claim). Watchable and entertaining but not among the best of Chomón's output.",4M

*** (out of 4) 

D.W. Griffith short about a bunch of bachelors who try to impress a woman by buying her niece some toys since she's coming to town. What they don't know is that this young girl is actually an older woman (Mary Pickford). This is more of a minor piece for Griffith but the comic timing is nice.

*** 1/2 (out of 4) 

D.W. Griffith short set during the American Revolution. An American soldier must get a letter of warning to George Washington while being cased by some British troops. Here's one where Griffith goes all out with an interesting story, great editing and some nice suspense. The film works very well as an early thriller.

She plays the damsel in distress, and, well, you can't fault her performance as it leaves little doubt that that's what she is.

We should not forget that this is 1909 and the requirement to survive in the new and novelty 'industry' at that time was mass production, they were knocking out more than 50 'movies' a year with limited equipment and a small group of regular performers. There was no time to waste, no time to be reflective and do multiple takes and experiments and then choose the best one. A decision was made then the action filmed - another dozen movies were lined up behind what was being done in the moment.

Griffith was the product of his time - his father a Southern military officer during the Civil War and DW of strict moralistic upbringing.

Griffith often visited moralistic themes in his movies and this was the prevalent thinking and attitudes of the time. In his own time nobody would have thought this over moralistic and, we shouldn't forget that 'Prohibition' was the end result of societies concerns over alcohol. This was the era in which lynchings of African Americans still spontaneously occurred, Chinese were called Chinks and it was illegal to cross marry.

Griffith had high visions for film as revealed in 1914 interviews were he saw them as a 'push button' teaching aid in libraries replacing books and encyclopedias. No doubt they could be used for 'moral' purposes as well.

This little film should not be seen just as Griffith going over-board on alcohol but a pointer to community values and concerns of the time. 

I believe the subject matter and purpose lent itself to melodramatic acting - it was intended rather than a flaw. The violence and harshness coming from alcohol abuse was deliberate and would have touched a chord with many.

The movie is not as bad as we would like to think in modern times - it should be judged in the context it was produced and the effect it was meant to achieve.",12M

Like other Méliès features it has a good sense of humour too. However, when you take into account the more elaborate narrative features that Méliès had already produced several years before, such as A Trip to the Moon and Kingdom of the Fairies, this does seem like quite regressive. Maybe it indicates why this famous innovator's career never really evolved any further, as he seemed to be essentially still making the same sort of films at a time of great change and evolution in the cinematic medium in general. A great shame, as he was easily the greatest presence in cinema in first decade of its existence.

This is just weird. Yep, very weird. But the effects, for 1909, are decent and the color is really, really nice. Flicker Alley must have done a lot of work to bring out the original look to the film with its vibrant hand-stenciled cels. Interesting but incomplete.",2M

""Moscow Clad in Snow"" was made during the late 1900s, a time when travelogues such as these were big with the company. Directors such as Segundo de Chomòn worked considerably on producing films of this genre for Pathé, with beautiful views of foreign lands to show the Frenchies back in France. This film is quite probably the best travelogue I've seen from that period, due to its advanced panning shots and beautiful scenery. There are historically interesting scenes of different sites such as Petrovsky Park, the Kremlin Bridge, a cracked bell and some Russian soldiers marching. Others are just scenes of beauty and awe, such as the trail and birds-eye city views.

It is interesting that this was the only movie Joseph-Louis Mundwiller directed. He clearly had a talent for cinematography and the camerawork here is even better than the likes of Chomòn. There are no involuntary movements in the panning, everything is slow and smooth for a movie of the time. Almost every shot has a pan and each of them is done top-notch for 1908.

Some of the most interesting scenes are the ones with the peasants working in the mushroom market. Some of them, having never seen a camera, are of course a little curious at what Mundwiller was doing--particularly one man who just smiles stupidly at the camera. Others are a little less extroverted and try their best to ignore it. I particularly like the part where the fishmonger smiles proudly at the camera as if to show off his wares. These points of interest add extra touches of humor to an otherwise serious documentary.

And if you're wondering about the date, I can clear that up. Wikipedia informs me that this movie was indeed shot to portray the Moscow winter of 1908, but was apparently released 1909. This makes sense considering how late in the year it would have been before Mundwiller got back to France and set the editors to work adding titles.",7M

Judging by the special effects, I could understand the film being attributed to Chomón but think IMDb might be right here as the style doesn't seem to be exactly his. Normally, you'd have expected Chomón to have more natural outdoor sets, a bit more subtlety and a bit more artistry.

""A Fancy Picnic"" starts off well enough. Four folks head out in a wagon (about circa 1830) on a picnic. However, their food is infested with mice, worms and bugs (all used by stopping the camera and making the food appear to become infested when the film was restarted). Then, they all return home and the narrative of the story gets completely lost. There is a lengthy animated section (one of the earliest known, actually) that really contributes nothing to the film and is more a distraction than anything else. In fact, the entire last 75% of the film is a non-stop demonstration of camera tricks, costumes and beautiful sets but none of this conveys a coherent story. All in all, there are a lot of neat tricks in a film that doesn't seem to say anything other than 'hey, look at my camera tricks!'.",8M

Returning to his apartment he dons his clothes and a mask, and goes out to pick pockets. He is chased by police and in the ensuing scuffle, they pull off his clothes and mask and find themselves fighting 'nothing'. Invisible again, the thief torments the terrified policemen who comically run away. Predating James Whale's 'The Invisible Man' (1933) by almost 25 years, Ferdinand Zecca's film is one of the first to attempt invisibility special effects. The trick is done by in-camera double exposure, so when the thief is invisible but still dressed, he is translucent (eventually the use of travelling mattes would avoid this problem) and the unexposed 'black' areas of the initial exposure were not perfect, so some image of the 'invisible' man is noticeable, but the film was made in 1909, so all this can be forgiven.

What I consider the best qualities of this era and genre are not really evident in this particular picture: that is, interesting lighting effects, use of mirrors as a self-referential device and impressive mise-en-scène. In ""The Abyss"", the framing is standard and extremely dated. There's one shot of an approaching train arriving at a station, a la the Lumière brothers' short, which I like to note only because there seem to be many such shots resembling those first films scattered throughout the early silent film era.

What ""The Abyss"" does have is sensationalism. The sex, including the dance, is part of this, as is ""the bad woman"" played by Asta Nielsen. And, as with most other such films I've seen, a circus must be involved. Alfred Lind, listed as the cinematographer of this picture, helped further create the sensational circus film genre with ""The Flying Circus"" (Den Flyvende cirkus) (1912). Moreover, the plotting in these types of films is nearly identical.

Besides being a notably early entry in sensational Danish circus melodramas, ""The Abyss"" also continues to receive some recognition for launching the screen career of Nielsen, who was an exceptionally popular international star, especially among German audiences. Her acting seems, compared to contemporaries, rather restrained, I suppose-- thankfully forgoing much of the usual theatrics. Overall, ""The Abyss"" might be worth seeing if you're interested in Nielsen or early Danish cinema.

Mr. Johnson feels awful, and takes the shaken, but unwounded, tramp out shopping. Mr. Sennett is so taken with Johnson's generosity, he attaches himself to his handsome new friend. At first, Johnson feels guilty; and, he lets Sennett hang around. Eventually, Johnson grows tired of having the adoring Sennett play Siamese twin, and throws the bum out. It doesn't last, however, as ""Faithful"" Sennett returns with a flower for his benefactor. Poor Johnson can't even spend time alone with his fiancée Florence Barker; understandably, she doesn't want to share her beau with his new companion 

Sennett's comic pathos makes this a very effective film; this time, he plays extraordinarily well with director D.W. Griffith, and his ideal leading man, Johnson. Sennett is especially sweet when he brings Johnson a flower; he is too simple-minded to mind being roughed up by Johnson. Although he is annoying, Sennett's ""Faithful"" elicits much sympathy. This is also a very nicely paced film, with a pleasant balance of comedy, drama, and suspense. As a bonus, look for a generous amount of early Hollywood location footage (around Biograph's Pico studio).

But it features the kind of heartfelt story that was so often characteristic of D.W. Griffith, at least when he was at his best. The social commentary in the story is well-aimed, and is still relevant over 90 years later, so that it's easily possible to appreciate the movie for that reason; but a more objective look reveals some ways that it could have been noticeably better.

The story shows a wealthy moneylender living in exorbitant luxury, even while he orders families to be forced out of their homes for being behind in their payments. The contrast between their sufferings and his plush lifestyle makes a definite impression, but it is carried out in a rather heavy-handed fashion, and a few years later Griffith would probably have come up with a more artful way of presenting the contrast. Too many of the key events are contrived, and this too he would have improved on later.

Film was just in its infancy in 1910 and full-length movies meant about 10-20 minutes. Sets and costumes were simple and often looked like they were taken right off the stage of a high school play. And, writing and acting as we know of them today, just wasn't invented yet. So I cut the early films a lot of slack and praise movies that actually had decent production values and provided some entertainment into the 21st century--most early films fail on both these counts.

The movie isn't really based on the books but on a stage musical and this at times is pretty obvious--especially when the characters start dancing for no apparent reason at all! But, aside from this odd way of telling the story, it's an adorable and interesting film--particularly as it has people in animal costumes throughout (not just the lion). It just seems very cute and makes watching this historical picture a lot easier! By the way, despite the good production values, this film is not as good as some of the full-length films by the Frenchman, Georges Méliès. His 1902 LE VOYAGE DAN LE LUNE has even better sets and tells a more coherent and watchable story--hence that is why it is rated as a 10 by me and this one only an 8.",13M

The acting itself is broadly comical, and the over the top performances help heighten this strange and almost surreal vibe the entire short has. The entire premise is absurd, largely because of what science has, by this time, taught us, and is in itself laughable, but also inexplicably helps heighten the film's confusing, bizarre, and flat out weird atmosphere. The film's most iconic visual by far is that of the giant alien lord(?), king(?), ruler(?), or something(?), the film never at all specifies much of what is going on (another element that helps heighten the atmosphere, albeit very possibly unintentionally), which looks like some sort of disturbing vision of Satan.

It's not very kind to any of the characters, with practically all of them being portrayed as either willful, calculating, oblivious, or worse. Their attempts to out-maneuver each other are clever at times, and would be even funnier if they were not quite so unkind.

John Bunny stars as a widower whose very spirited young daughter sets off a rivalry between her nurse and her governess. Bunny actually is the straight man for much of the movie, with the female characters driving most of the action. Bunny does get some good moments with the daughter, but otherwise he does not get many chances to use his range of comic talents.

Flora Finch, Bunny's frequent co-star, plays the strict governess, and she efficiently establishes her character right away. Helene Costello makes the child lively and suitably impish. Mae Costello, probably the least-remembered performer from the well-known acting family, might actually give the best performance of anyone in the movie. As the child's nurse, she is just as devious as (or more so than) any of other characters, but her manner makes you want her to be the one who succeeds.

So few of Bunny's movies have been preserved that the chance to see any of them is welcome. This one, though, does not really give him a chance to show all that he could do. It does work all right as light entertainment.",14M

This was his first. Typically, the animation exists as a sort of meta narrative, while McCay himself appears in a miniature framing story where he is challenged to produce moving drawings in a certain amount of time. The same device appears in most prints of Gertie the Dinosaur. McCay was a lightning sketch artist and did performances of his swift drawings, so moving picture animation was really an extension of the idea of rapid sketching providing dynamic impressions of motion in his work. Restricted from travelling with his shows by the newspaper that didn't want to lose his cartoons from its pages, it also meant that he could diffuse his talents internationally despite being confined to New York for long periods at a time. The drawings in Little Nemo do not tell a story as such, but instead show characters delighting in their freedom to ""stretch and squash"", elongating their bodies to demonstrate the malleability of the medium. When Disney studios established its basic principles of animation which would be common to all of its anthropomorphised animal characters, ""stretch and squash"" was one of the variables which could be applied to a character to give it a distinctive movement. In Disney, the more comedic a character is, the more stretchy and squashy it will be. For McCay, the elasticity of the characters is a way of displaying their triumph over the usual physical laws governing organic bodies. McCay was not concerned with simplistic comedy, as can be witnessed most strikingly in 'The Sinking of the Lusitania'(1918). In the early days of animation, there was no rule which said animation had to be deployed solely for childish comedy, but the industry gradually forced into that pigeonhole to suppress its more (potentially) subversive elements. Kristin Thompson writes superbly on this subject if you're interested. A video and DVD is available featuring all of McCay's animated cartoons. Anyone interested in the history of animation, or early cinema in general, must see it all.",7M

Taking visual inspiration from Gustav Doré's iconic illustrations, Giuseppe de Liguoro worked for more than three years with 150 people and what was then the biggest film budget ever to complete his masterpiece.

Newly restored from a variety of sources, it's still an amazing visual experience as the poet Virgil leads Dante on a journey through Purgatory and Hell.

L'Inferno's pantheon of demons and sinners are imaginatively conjured up on ambitious sets using a variety of then-pioneering cinematic tricks such as forced perspective to allow a gigantic Pluto to rage at the dwarfed interlopers, overlays for when they arrive at the city of Dis and see furies scaling the battlements and an ingenious combination of miniatures and live action to create remarkable encounters with three chained giants and a final confrontation with Lucifer himself.

In between these set pieces, Dante and his guide meet a rogues gallery of history's great sinners and the ironically apposite corners of Hell reserved just for them.

The only real pitchfork in the backside of this otherwise commendable project is the decision to harness the visuals to a soundtrack culled from Tangerine Dream's concept album based on the same literary source.

It's not the German electronic outfit's best work and comes with the additional burden of vocals which tend to detract from the Gothic mood created by the visuals alone.

What is interesting about this film is that Mary Pickford mentions it in her writings and interviews and was well pleased with herself because Griffith gave her some praise for her dare-devil driving. In other words he said 'good girl' which Mary said made her feel quite good. (Obviously Griffith was short on compliments).

This was one of the first and is claimed to be the first 'real' car chase and train race. Mary said she got up to 54 miles per hour in the chase and went around the corner quite fast (Griffith wasn't happy until she did it fast - almost too fast) her driving coach was hidden on the floor of the car out of site in this scene. Mary said that her mother Charlotte actually stayed at home prayed for her while she was doing this chase scene. So this was something special in the history of film making. There is also excitement in the car behind Mary also in the chase - they went over a small raise in the dirt road fast and the back seat passengers (open top) were thrown up into the air about a foot. A little faster and you feel they would have been thrown out.

This shows that Griffith was pushing for something than the mundane and, achieved it.

Early in the film you should note that Mary is very comfortable driving the car, a real natural and you get the feeling she had lots of practice. She loved owing and driving cars.

The race with the train is brilliant and you get a real sense of speed and tension and close competition.

It marks Griffith's last collaboration with Mary Pickford before her departure for the Famous Players Company, and it presents a youthful Lionel Barrymore in a prominent role as the pastor who takes a benevolent interest in Mary. Sharp-eyed viewers might also catch a glimpse of Lillian Gish in a brief bit outside the church. History and casting aside, the movie itself holds up quite well as entertainment.

From the very first scene Mary has our sympathy. The death of her mother has left her in the care of a sour, miserly father who is not attentive to her needs, and when she receives a fancy hat as a gift it clearly means a great deal to her. As the story unfolds we become increasingly involved in her situation, indignant at her mean-spirited father, and irritated with the town gossips who assume the worst about the pastor's intentions towards Mary. The age of the film is forgotten when Mary's father rips her beloved hat apart and throws it to the ground. We feel for her, we want to see justice done, and we want to see that old miser brought low. In this regard, the ending is especially satisfying.

It's interesting to find that this early work features thematic elements that would recur in films by both director and star. Several of Mary Pickford's strongest vehicles present her as a lower class girl who is painfully aware of her status, and longs for acceptance by her 'betters' -- who, as often as not, are snobs unworthy of her admiration. Griffith, meanwhile, went on to demonstrate a special contempt for busybodies in his later work, such as the ""reformer ladies"" in the modern story of Intolerance.

Still, while the gossips of The New York Hat richly earn our scorn, the sympathetic pastor's actions look naive at best. Shouldn't he have expected people to wonder about the nature of his relationship with this young girl? The girl's exact age is not stated and is hard to determine (Mary Pickford was 20 years old when the film was made, but she could have passed for 16 or even younger), but in any case you'd think he would have been a little more circumspect. One question left unexplored at the end is the whether the gossips are correct in their assumption that the pastor is interested in Mary in a, shall we say, more than fatherly way.

I don't like the idea expressed in the story that a woman has to put on a lot of makeup to attract a man. In fact, in this case, the actress playing the ""plain"" and often-rejected girl, is pretty without it. She's Blanche Sweet, who starred in a ton of silent movies including many in her teenage years. Although only in her mid-teens when this was made (perhaps even 14), she looked more mature.

In this story, as we see, shyness and a too-strict father are also making a dating life almost nonexistent for poor, makeup-less ""the older sister"" (Sweet).

What happens in this story is very strange, and you can read various accounts of it here. I guess the lonely girl wasn't too good at figuring out men. Chalk it up to loneliness and inexperience. What happens in her house, though, is too weird and dates the movie quite a bit. But, that's to be expected. After all, the movie isn't far from being 100 years old. 

It's nice that these old D.W. Griffith shorts are still available to the public, even if they look a little odd.",12M

It has several good features that compensate for the lack of dialogue and the other cinematic limitations of the time.  The result is something a bit different from watching the play, but still a good story that does retain much of the emphasis of the original.

The adaptation is noteworthy for the liveliness and the detail that went into most of the scenes.  They also made generally good decisions in adapting the story, by high-lighting the parts that would work most effectively on film without dialogue, and also in filming some events that were not actually in the play but to which characters in the play refer. While the lack of dialogue means that the character of Richard is not as complex as he is in the play, Frederick Warde does a good job of making his basic character come out.  Some of his scenes work better than you might have expected them to without the advantage of spoken lines.  The camera is fixed for each scene, as was then the norm, and it also uses the old-fashioned 'tableau' format, but there are a number of uses of cross-cutting, and there are also a couple of simple tracking shots at effectively chosen moments.

Overall, this is creative for its era, and it works quite well.  It deserves to be seen in its own right, as well as for its more well-known historical significance.",55M

The same falls in love with her employer's son, whom his father   then sends away, one infers - the audience of the time would at any rate - in order to  end the socially inappropriate relationship, but in fact so that he may use his power to take advantage of her, by force. She and her aged father are summarily dismissed; taken  in by a wealthy patron, when he dies his family casts her out, into the demimonde (note  her cigarette!) of the overclass' student life. A final set piece has her body, strewn with  thorn roses, accusing the cause of her ruin.

 The plot is incomplete, and these short moral films are not in fashion now, to say the  least; but well worth seeing, in the context of retrospectives of Sjostrom's excellent  work.",

The Soviets had little interest in praising the works of the Tsarist period; little is available, except for those few works distributed worldwide by the Pathe organization; nor had Soviet cinema broken free of its roots in stage and portraiture.

There was a major industry, and Vasili Goncharov was a major player, until his death in 1915. Although the IMDb shows this film of the French occupation of Moscow as a short, in the era it was produced, it was a feature.

The modern viewer will have some issues with it. The acting, particularly by Pavel Knorr as Napoleon, is stagy and its format is that of the illustrated text that was beginning to go out of style even then. However, Goncharov and his co-directors clearly know what they are doing. Although the shots are held for what is today for an excruciatingly long time, the compositions are fine and there is plenty of movement within the frame (usually consisting of masses of soldiers). Viewed as a modern film, 1812 will not be particularly good. Viewed as an example of a different film grammar, it is very good.",48M

Much of what you see in ""Métamorphoses"" looks like the work of this other filmmaker...though it's a nice looking short film regardless.

A woman dressed in unusual garb is doing magic on camera. But instead of looking and acting like a magician, you can only guess that she's a fairy or witch or goddess or whatnot. She uses her want to make burning things turn into other things (done by stopping and starting the camera as well as reversing the footage). Then, she begins turning things into other things....and the film ends.

Henry B. Walthall, as the fickle and then troubled husband, is the star of the film, although Walter Miller and Blanche Sweet have key roles, too.
